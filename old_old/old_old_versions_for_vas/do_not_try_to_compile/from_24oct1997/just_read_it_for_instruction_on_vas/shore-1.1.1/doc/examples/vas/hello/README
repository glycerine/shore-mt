This is an example VAS, called hello, that stores the string
``hello world!'' using the SSM and then prints it.

To do this, the program:
    configures the SSM
    formats a storage device
    creates a volume on the device,
    creates a file on the volume, 
    creates a record, in the file, containing the string ``hello''
    appends ``world!'' to the record
    reads the record and prints it
    shuts down the SSM

The hello program demonstrates how to start the SSM use some of its
basic features to store data.  Compiling and running it is a quick
way to test that your Shore SM installation is correct.

The hello program is rather large (aproximately 200 lines) for programs
of its kind.  Our excuse is that an analogous program/script for
Unix would be one that partitions a disk, creates a file-system on
it, creates a directory and a file to hold ``hello world!'' and then
reads the file.

Compiling and Running
---------------------

To compile and run this example, please see the instructions in the
"Shore Software Installation Manual" in the section "Compiling and Running a
Value-Added Server".  A copy of this manual is available on the Web at
