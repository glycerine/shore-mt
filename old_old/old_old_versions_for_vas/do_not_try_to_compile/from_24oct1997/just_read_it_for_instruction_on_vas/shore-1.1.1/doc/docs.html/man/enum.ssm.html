<H2><A NAME="HRR.2.1">enum ss_m::concurrency_t</A></H2>
<P>
The enumeration,
 <strong>ss_m::concurrency_t</strong>
is used for specifying locking granularity.
Lock granularity comes in several flavors, depending on
the context in which it is used. In any case, it is based on a
lock hierarchy. 
The lock hierarchy for files is: volume, file, page, record. 
The hierarchy for indexes is: volume, index, key-value.  
The values for the enumeration have the following
general meanings (more specific meanings are described in the
manual pages for the context in which they are used):

<DL>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_none:</DT><DD>
No locking is to be done.
The responsibility for consistency lies with the 
user of the SSM service being invoked.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_volume:</DT><DD>
Acquire only volume locks.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_file:</DT><DD>
Acquire file or index locks (and volume
locks resulting from the hierarchy).

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_page:</DT><DD>
Acquire page locks, along with the file, and volume locks
determined by the hierarchy.
(Page locks are never acquired for indexes.)

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_record:</DT><DD>
Acquire record locks, and acquire the
page, file, and volume locks determined by the hierarchy.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_kvl:</DT><DD>
Acquire key-value (predicate) locks, along with the
index and volume  locks determined by the hierarchy.
This is the default locking protocol for B+ trees, and
when it is used, next-key locks are acquired for phantom
protection, giving full degree-3 transaction isolation.
See 
<em>Gray, J., Reuter, A.  Transaction Processing: concepts and techniques, 1993.</em>
for to learn about predicate locking and transaction isolation.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_modkvl:</DT><DD>
This is a simplistic form of 
key-value locking, in which there is no phantom protection.
When used, range scans on indexes are not permitted.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_cc_im:</DT><DD>
This locking protocol can be used with B+ tree indexes that are
used as access methods.  It works ONLY for indexes whose
values are record identifiers.  
When used, the index manager acquires record locks, along with the
page, file, and volume locks determined by the hierarchy,
for records identified by the index entries.


</DD>

<H2><A NAME="HRR.2.2">enum ss_m::store_property_t</A></H2>
<P>
The enumeration
 <strong>ss_m::store_property_t</strong>
identifies special properties that a store (a set of pages;
a file or an index)
may have.
A store can be given one of these properties
when the store is created, and subsequently
it can be given a different property.  
This is useful for bulk-loading. 
<P>
The enumerated values have the following meanings:

<DL>
<DT>ss_m::t_regular:</DT><DD>
Updates to the store (file or index) are logged, providing the
Durability property in ACID transactions.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_temporary:</DT><DD>
File or index is temporary.  This means that no logging 
will be done on the data in the store, and the effect of 
rollback on updates is undefined.
(The store's structural integrity is guaranteed by logging,
but the user's data within the store are not. In the case
of B+trees and R*trees, the integrity of the tree is NOT
guaranteed; only the integrity of the underlying store
is guaranteed. In event of abort, the index must be destroyed.)
Temporary stores are removed when the volumes containing them
are dismounted or mounted; consequently, temporary stores
do not survive crashes.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_load_file:</DT><DD>
A store that is created with this property starts out as
a temporary store, and is converted to a regular store at 
commit time.

</DD>
<DT>ss_m::t_insert_file:</DT><DD>
Updates to existing pages of the store are fully-logged 
(as if the store had the property
 <em>ss_m::t_regular</em>
),  but pages allocated (while the store has this property)
are not logged.  This makes sense in the context in which
a store is bulk-loaded in one transaction (with property
 <em>ss_m::t_load_file</em>
), and more data are appended in a subsequent transaction.
To avoid the cost of logging, the latter 
transaction would convert the store's property to
 <em>ss_m::t_insert_file,</em>
append its data, and convert the store's property back to
 <em>ss_m::t_regular.</em>
