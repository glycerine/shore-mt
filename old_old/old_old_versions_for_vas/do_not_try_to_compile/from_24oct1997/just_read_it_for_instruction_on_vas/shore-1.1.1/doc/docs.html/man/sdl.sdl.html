<H1><A NAME="HRR.2">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
This is the Shore Data Language (SDL) compiler, linker,
and C++ language binding generator.
It performs one or more of these functions, determined by
command-line arguments.  
 <strong>Sdl</strong>
is itself a Shore/SDL application program, and uses the
Shore database to store information about the types it
processes.
Consequently, 
<em>you must have a Shore server running</em>
when you use
 <strong>sdl.</strong>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.2.1">Processing your SDL module descriptions</A></H2>
<P>
When compiling an SDL source file, 
 <strong>sdl</strong>
processes one or more SDL module definitions; for each such
definition processed, it creates a
<em>module object</em>
within the Shore database.  
Each module object is a  registered object in the Shore
namespace.  These module objects are used as the basis
for further processing.
 <strong>sdl</strong>
also creates a collection of other objects in the database
which contain information about the types specified within the
module; the 
<em>module object</em>
is used as the root object for any access to these objects.
<H2><A NAME="HRR.2.2">Linking your SDL modules objects together</A></H2>
<P>
If an SDL module specification uses types that are defined in a different
module, the appropriate modules objects must be linked.  
That is, any intermodule
references within a given module must be resolved with respect to other
module objects within the Shore database.
Linking resolves intermodule references.
If a module definition makes no intermodule
references, linking of the corresponding module object is not required.
<H2><A NAME="HRR.2.3">Generating a language binding.</A></H2>
<P>
Language binding generation for a module object creates a 
C++ header file
containing class definitions corresponding to each object type
specified by that module,and other
runtime support code  used in creating objects of these types
and moving these objects in and out of application program
memory.
It also allows operations on object  types to be specified
as member functions of the corresponding C++ class produced
by the language binding.
<P>
Shore now has one target language - C++.
For further information on use of the C++ language binding,
see
<A HREF="intro.cxxlb.html"><STRONG>intro(cxxlb)</STRONG></A>.
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.3">IMPORTANT NOTE</A></H1>
The Shore Server process,
<tt>shore,</tt>
must already be running when 
<tt>sdl</tt>
is invoked.

 <strong>Sdl</strong>
reads the configuration file
<tt>.shoreconfig</tt>
in the current directory, if it exists, and
if not, in 
<tt>$HOME/.shoreconfig,</tt>
if it exists.
If neither exists, 
 <strong>sdl</strong>
will fail to contact the server.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.4">OPTIONS</A></H1>
<DL>
<DT>-s sourcefile</DT><DD>
Process the SDL source file
 <em>sourcefile</em>.
If no errors occur, a module object is created for
each SDL module definition in 
 <em>sourcefile</em>,
using the module name tag in the source file
as the final component of the path name for the
module object.  The module objects are created within the 
first directory specified using the 
 <strong>-d</strong>
option described below; if no such option is used, the module object is created
in the Shore directory
<tt>/types .</tt>
If the name of the file is
 `<strong>-</strong>',
the standard input is used as source for the  compilation.  If
standard input is used as source, it must be the first source
file specified.
</DD>
<DT>-S</DT><DD>
Use standard input as SDL source.
This is equivalent to 
<strong>-s</strong>
 -.
</DD>
<DT>-f</DT><DD>
Overwrite existing module if its reference count is zero.
A module shows up in the name space in two places: as 
a pool and as another registered object,
both with names derived from the eponymous module.
If the
<strong>-f</strong>
flag is not set, the  compilation will abort if 
either of the objects exists  and the module has
a zero reference count.

<PP>
If the module has a non-zero reference count,
the module will not be removed even if
<strong>-f</strong>
is used.
Under these circumstances, you can remove the module
objects and any remaining instances &quot;by hand&quot; (through a
non-SDL path such as NFS or the server's Tcl interface),
Be aware that this will make applications behave in an
undefined manner when operating on instance objects that were built
with the previous version of the module.
If you destroy a module &quot;by hand&quot;, you should destroy your
database as well.
<PP>
Reference counting is off by default;
it can be turned on 
with the configuration options
<tt>oc_refcount</tt>
(see
<A HREF="options.oc.html"><STRONG>options(oc)</STRONG></A>;
 <em>caveat emptor</em>).

</DD>
<DT>-c</DT><DD>
Do a quick  syntax check only on any  SDL source.  The Shore
server need not be running if this flag is set; any operations
other than compilation will fail if 
 -c
is used.
</DD>
<DT>-v</DT><DD>
Verbose mode; print out command line arguments; then print what
<strong>sdl</strong>
thinks it is doing.
</DD>
<DT>-l modulename</DT><DD>
Link the named  module object; attempt to resolve any intermodule 
references within
 <em>modulename</em>.
Modules used in resolving these references will be any other
modules specified named the
 <strong>use</strong>
and
 <strong>import</strong>
statements in the SDL specification of
 <em>modulename</em>;
sdl 
will search for corresponding modules in the list of other modules
specified using 
 <strong>-l</strong>
and in any directories specified using
 <strong>-d</strong>.
</DD>
<DT>-L</DT><DD>
Link all modules created from SDL source in this run.
</DD>
<DT>-b modulename</DT><DD>
Produce a C++ language binding for the  named  module object; create
a header file 
 <em>modulename.h</em>
which may be included by C++ application source.  Any intermodule
references within
 <em>modulename</em>
must have been resolved via linking before a language binding
may be produced.
</DD>
<DT>-B</DT><DD>
Produce C++ language bindings for all modules created from source
in this run. Normally there will be one header file per module, but
see -o below.
</DD>
<DT>-o  outputfile</DT><DD>
Send the C++ language binding output from any modules specified with
 <strong>-b</strong>
or
 <strong>-B</strong>
to the unix file
 <em>outputfile</em>.
If the name of the file is
 `<strong>-</strong>',
the standard output is used as the  output file.
</DD>
<DT>-d  pathname</DT><DD>
Insert the Shore directory
<em>pathname</em>
in the search path used for module name lookup  during linking and
language binding creation; the first directory specified  is
also used as the destination for any modules created during compilation.
The Shore directory 
<tt>/types</tt>
is the directory used if no 
&quot;-d&quot; arguments are given.
</DD>
