Storage Facilities</A>
</H1>
<P>
The SSM provides a hierarchy of storage structures.  A description
of each type of storage structure is given below, followed by
a description of the identifiers used to refer to them.
<P><A NAME="ssmapi:devices">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000000">
Devices</A>
</H2>
<P>
A <EM>device</EM> is a location, provided by the operating system, for
storing data.  In the current implementation, a device is either a
disk partition or an operating system file.  A device is identified by
the name used to access it through the operating system.  Each device
is managed by a single server.  A device has a quota.  The sum of the
quotas of all the volumes on a device cannot exceed the device quota.
<EM>Note</EM> : Devices are currently limited to containing only one volume.
<P>
The device management interface is part of class <TT>ss_m</TT>
and is described in
<A NAME="tex2html11"
 HREF="../man/device.ssm.html">device(ssm)</A>.
<P>
For each mounted device, the server forks a process called <TT>diskrw</TT>
(determined by the <TT>sm_diskrw</TT> option) to perform asynchronous
I/O on the device.  These processes communicate with the server
through sockets and shared memory, so your operating system must be configured
with shared memory support.
<P><A NAME="ssmapi:volumes">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000000">
Volumes</A>
</H2>
<P>
A <EM>volume</EM> is a collection of file and index storage structures
(described below) managed as a unit.  All storage structures reside
entirely on one volume.  A volume has a quota specifying how
must large it can grow.
Every volume has a dedicated
<A HREF="node4.html#ssmapi:btree">B+-tree index</A>, called the <EM>root index</EM>,
to be used for cataloging the data on the volume.
<P>
The volume management interface is part of class <TT>ss_m</TT>
and is described in
<A NAME="tex2html12"
 HREF="../man/volume.ssm.html">volume(ssm)</A>.
<P><A NAME="ssmapi:files">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000000">
Files of Records</A>
</H2>
<P>
A <EM>record</EM> <A NAME="tex2html13"
 HREF="footnode.html#330"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../icons.gif/foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>
is an un-typed container
of bytes, consisting of a <EM>tag</EM>, <EM>header</EM> and <EM>body</EM>.
The tag is a small, read-only location that stores the record size
and other implementation-related information.  The header has a variable
length, but it limited by the size of a physical disk page.
A VAS may store -information about the record (such as its type) in the header.
The body is the primary data storage location and can range in size from zero
bytes to 4-GB.  A record can grow and shrink in size by operations
that append and truncate bytes at the end of the record.
<P>
A <EM>file</EM> is a collection of records.  Files are used for
clustering records and have an interface for iterating over all the
records they contain.  The number of records that a file can hold is
limited only by the space available on the volume containing the file.
The minimum size of a file is 64K-bytes (8 pages).  We are working on
ways to reduce this to 8K, but in any case, using a file to store
a collection containing only a few small records will waste space.
<P>
Methods for creating/destroying files and creating/destroying/modifying
records are part of class <TT>ss_m</TT> and described in
<A NAME="tex2html14"
 HREF="../man/file.ssm.html">file(ssm)</A>.
There is a <TT>pin_i</TT> class for
pinning records for reading and modifying.  This class is
documented in <A NAME="tex2html15"
 HREF="../man/pin_i.ssm.html">pin_i(ssm)</A>.
There are the classes
<TT>scan_file_i</TT> for iterating over the records in a file,
and
<TT>append_file_i</TT> for appending records to a file.
Both are described in
<A NAME="tex2html16"
 HREF="../man/scan_file_i.ssm.html">scan_file_i(ssm)</A>.
<P><A NAME="ssmapi:btree">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00044000000000000000000">
B+tree Indexes</A>
</H2>
<P>
The <EM>B+tree index</EM> facility provides associative access to data.
Keys and their associated values can be variable length (up to the
size of a page).  Keys can be composed of any of the basic C-language types
or variable length character strings.  A bulk-loading facility is provided.
The number of key-value pairs that an index can hold is limited only
by the space available on the volume containing the index.  The minimum
size of a B+tree index is 8K-bytes (1 page).
<P>
Methods for index operations are part of class
<TT>ss_m</TT> and described in
<A NAME="tex2html17"
 HREF="../man/btree.ssm.html">btree(ssm)</A>.
There is <TT>scan_index_i</TT> class for iterating over
a range of keys in the index
This class is documented in
<A NAME="tex2html18"
 HREF="../man/scan_index_i.ssm.html">scan_index_i(ssm)</A>.
<P><A NAME="ssmapi:rtree">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00045000000000000000000">
R*Tree Indexes</A>
</H2>
<P>
An <EM>R-Tree</EM> is a height-balanced tree structure designed specifically
for indexing multi-dimensional spatial objects. It stores the
<EM>minimum bounding box</EM> (with 2 or more dimensions) of a spatial object
as the key in the leaf pages.  The current implementation in SHORE is
a variant of R-Tree called <EM>R*-Tree</EM>
[<A
 HREF="node12.html#bk:rtree">BKSS90</A>], which improves the search
performance by using a better heuristic for redistributing entries
and dynamically reorganizing the tree during insertion.
Currently, only 2-dimensional R*-trees with integer coordinates
are supported by the SSM.
A bulk-loading facility is provided.
The number of key-value pairs that an index can hold is limited only
by the space available on the volume containing the index.
The minimum size of an R*tree index is 64K-bytes (8 pages).
<P>
The R*-Tree implementation stores [key, value] pairs, where
the key is of type
<A NAME="tex2html19"
 HREF="../man/nbox_t.common.html"><TT>nbox_t</TT></A>.
and the value is of type
<A NAME="tex2html20"
 HREF="../man/vec_t.common.html"><TT>vec_t</TT></A>. A 2-D <TT>nbox_t</TT> is a
rectangle which stores coordinates in the order of x_low, y_low,
x_high, y_high (lower left point and higher right point). Currently,
only  integer values are supported for the coordinates.
<P>
Methods for R*-tree index operations are part of class
<TT>ss_m</TT> and described in
<A NAME="tex2html21"
 HREF="../man/rtree.ssm.html">rtree(ssm)</A>.
There is <TT>scan_rt_i</TT> class for iterating over
a range of keys in the index
This class is documented in
<A NAME="tex2html22"
 HREF="../man/scan_rt_i.ssm.html">scan_rt_i(ssm)</A>.
<P><A NAME="ssmapi:identifiers">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00046000000000000000000">
Identifiers</A>
</H2>
<P>
Volumes, files, records and indexes all have identifiers.
There are two broad categories of identifiers: <EM>logical</EM> and
<EM>physical</EM>.  Logical IDs are location-independent;
there is a level of indirection for mapping the ID to a physical
location.  Physical IDs are location-dependent; they
refer to the physical location (usually location on disk) of the
referenced object.
<EM>Although the SSM has both physical and logical ID versions of its
interface, only the version using logical IDs is supported at this
time</EM>.
<P>
A volume ID (<TT>lvid_t</TT>) is a globally unique, 8-byte identifier;
see <A NAME="tex2html23"
 HREF="../man/lid_t.common.html"><TT>lid_t(common)</TT></A>.
File, record, and index IDs are formed by appending to a volume ID
a serial number (see <A NAME="tex2html24"
 HREF="../man/serial_t.common.html"><TT>serial_t</TT></A>)
unique to the volume containing them.
Serial numbers are currently 4 bytes long, but we plan to make
them 8 bytes long in the future.
The complete ID for a file, index or record is a combination
of the volume ID and serial number (<TT>lid_t</TT>) described
in <A NAME="tex2html25"
 HREF="../man/lid_t.common.html">lid_t(common)</A>.
Serial numbers are never reused.
A counter stored on the volume is used generate serial numbers.
It is initialized when the volume is formatted an incremented each time
a new serial number is needed.
<P>
When a pointer to a record is stored on disk, only the serial number is
stored.  A bit in the serial number indicates whether the pointer is
local (to a record on the volume) to remote.
If the pointer is remote, an index on the volume is used to store
the volume ID of the record.
This technique can significantly reduce the size of databases containing many
pointers.
<P>
Methods for operating on IDs and generating remote references
are described in <A NAME="tex2html26"
 HREF="../man/lid.ssm.html">lid(ssm)</A>.
