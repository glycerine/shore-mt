<H1><A NAME="HRR.2">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>

The above class
 <strong>ss_m</strong>
methods all deal with transaction management.
See the transaction section of the
<A HREF="../ssmapi/ssmapi.html">SSM interface document</A>
for more information.


<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.3">TRANSACTION METHODS</A></H1>

<P>
<strong>begin_xct(timeout)</strong>
<P>
<strong>begin_xct(tid, timeout)</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>begin_xct</strong>
method begins a new transaction and associates the current
thread with the transaction.
The
 <em>tid</em>
returns the transaction ID of the new transaction.
The
 <em>timeout</em>
parameter specifies the default amount of time the current 
thread should block when waiting to obtain a lock on behalf of the
transaction.  There are three commonly used values for this parameter:
<DT>WAIT_FOREVER</DT><DD>
This value indicates that the thread should block for up to
an unlimited amount of time when waiting for a lock.
</DD>
<DT>WAIT_IMMEDIATE</DT><DD>
This value indicates that the thread should not block for
any locks.
</DD>
<DT>WAIT_SPECIFIED_BY_THREAD</DT><DD>
This value indicates that the amount of time to block should
be based on the thread's lock timeout setting.  See
<A HREF="smthread_t.ssm.html"><STRONG>smthread_t(ssm)</STRONG></A>
for more details.
<PP>
Using the default, WAIT_SPECIFIED_BY_THREAD, is usually appropriate
as the default for the thread is WAIT_FOREVER.
<PP>
<strong>Note: Nested transactions are not supported.  Therefore, it</strong>
is an error to call
 <strong>begin_xct</strong>
while the current thread is already associated with a transaction.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>
<strong>commit_xct(lazy)</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>commit_xct</strong>
method commits the transaction associated with the current thread.
If
 <strong>commit_xct</strong>
returns successfully, all changes made by the transaction are
guaranteed to be persistent, even if the server should crash.
All locks held by the transaction are released.
When the
 <em>lazy</em>
parameter is set the
<strong>true,</strong>
the the transaction commit log record is not actually written to the disk.
The transaction's changes (on volumes) are not persistent until the
commit log record is written to the disk.  Therefore, if a crash should
occur immediately after a &quot;lazy&quot; commit, the transaction would be
rolled back.
However, if any subsequent
log record makes it to disk, then the commit record will also be on
disk.  In addition, all lazy commit log records will be written
to the disk every 30 seconds.

<P>
</DL>
<strong>abort_xct()</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>abort_xct</strong>
method rolls back all changes (on volumes) made by the transaction
and ends the transaction.

<P>
</DL>
<strong>chain_xct(lazy)</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>chain_xct</strong>
method commits the current transaction and begins another
one just as
 <strong>begin_xct</strong>
would do.  In addition, all lock held by the current transaction
are transfered to the new transaction.
The
 <em>lazy</em>
parameter functions as it does for
 <strong>commit_xct.</strong>

<P>
</DL>
<strong>save_work()</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>save_work</strong>
method marks a &quot;save point&quot; and fills the
 <em>sp</em>
parameter with information about it.  

<P>
</DL>
<strong>rollback_work()</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>rollback_work</strong>
method uses the log to roll back all changes (on volumes) made
since the save point indicated by the
 <em>sp</em>
parameter.
No locks are released.

</DL>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.4">TRANSACTION STATES</A></H1>
<P>
<strong>state_xct()</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>state_xct</strong>
method returns the current state of the transaction pointed to by
 <em>xct.</em>
<P>
</DL>
The states are 
<tt>{xct_stale, xct_active, xct_prepared, xct_aborting, xct_chaining, xct_committing, xct_ended}.</tt>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.5">ATTACHING TRANSACTIONS TO THREADS</A></H1>
The transaction pointer for the current threads is
available via
 <strong>smthread_t::xct.</strong>
See
<A HREF="smthread_t.ssm.html"><STRONG>smthread_t(ssm)</STRONG></A>.
for more information.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.6">TRANSACTION IDENTIFIERS </A></H1>

Transactions are identified by a transaction ID,
 <strong>tid_t.</strong>Internal<strong>to</strong>the<strong>SM,</strong>there<strong>is</strong>also<strong>a</strong>transaction<strong>structure,</strong>
 <strong>xct_t,</strong>
holding information about the transaction.  So, a pointer to
an
 <strong>xct_t</strong>can<strong>also</strong>be<strong>used</strong>to<strong>identify</strong>a<strong>transaction.</strong>Other
SM interfaces, including
<A HREF="smthread_t.ssm.html"><STRONG>smthread_t(ssm)</STRONG></A>
use
 <strong>xct_t</strong>
pointers to avoid the transaction from 
 <strong>tid_t.</strong>


<P>
<strong>tid_to_xct()</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>tid_to_xct</strong>
methods converts a transaction ID in to an
 <strong>xct_t</strong>
pointer.

<P>
</DL>
<strong>xct_to_tid()</strong>
<DL>
<PP>
The
 <strong>xct_to_tid</strong>
method converts a 
 <strong>xct_t*</strong>
to a transaction ID.


</DL>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.7">DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTIONS</A></H1>
<P>
The Shore storage manager can participate
in transactions coordinated by other software modules
that employ the 
&quot;presumed abort&quot; 
two-phase commit
protocol.
The coordinator in such a situation is external to the Shore
storage manager; it is assumed to have its own stable storage, 
and it is assumed to recover from failures in a 
<em>short time,</em>
the precice meaning of which is given below.
<P>
A prepared transaction, like an active transaction,
consumes log space and holds locks.
Even if a prepared transaction does not hold locks
needed by other transactions, it consumes resources in a way
that can interfere with other transactions.
If a prepared transaction remains in the system
for a long time while other transactions are running,
eventually the storage manager needs the log space
used (reserved) by the prepared transaction.
A coordinator must resolve its prepared transactions
before the storage manager effectively runs out of 
log space for other transactions in the system.
The amount of time involved is a function of the size of the log
and of the demands of the other transactions in the system.
<P>
For the purpose of this discussion, the portion of a global
transaction that involves a single Shore transaction
is calld a
<em>thread</em>
of the global transaction.
<P>
A Shore transaction participates as a thread of a 
<em>global transaction</em>
as follows:
<DL>
<DT>Start</DT><DD>
a Shore transaction with 
 <strong>begin_xct.</strong>
</DD>
<DT>Acquire</DT><DD>
a global transaction identifier
from the coordinator.
</DD>
<DT>Indicate</DT><DD>
to the Shore storage manager that this Shore transaction
is a thread of a global transaction, and associate the
global transaction identifier with this thread by calling
 <strong>enter_2pc.</strong>
</DD>
<DT>Associate</DT><DD>
a coordinator with the transaction for recovery purposes,
by calling
 <strong>set_coordinator.</strong>
</DD>
<DT>Prepare</DT><DD>
the Shore thread of the transaction and get the 
Shore storage manager's vote with
 <strong>prepare_xct.</strong>
It is an error to commit a global transaction thread
without first preparing it.
It is an error to do anything else in a transaction
after it is prepared, except to end the transaction
or retry the prepare (to get the vote again).
</DD>
<DT>Convey</DT><DD>
the vote to the coordinator, and determine 
the transaction's fate 
from the coordinator.
</DD>
<DT>End</DT><DD>
the thread with
 <strong>commit_xct</strong>
or 
 <strong>abort_xct.</strong>
 
</DD>
</DL>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.8">GLOBAL TRANSACTION IDENTIFIERS </A></H1>
<P>
A global transaction identifier is an opaque
value to the Shore storage manager.  It uses a
template class defined as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
template &lt;int LEN&gt; class opaque_quantity {
private:
    uint4         _length;
    unsigned char _opaque[LEN];
public:
                          opaque_quantity();
                          opaque_quantity(const char* s);
    friend bool operator  ==(const opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp;,
		           const opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp;); 
    friend ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;o, const opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp;);
    opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp; operator=(const opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp;);
    opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp; operator=(const char*);
    opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp; operator+=(const char*);
    opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp; operator-=(uint4 len);
    opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp; append(const void* data, uint4 len);
    opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp; zero();  // zero entire max-sized data structure
    opaque_quantity&lt;LEN&gt;&amp; clear(); // zero length only
    operator              const char *();
    void *                data_at_offset(uint i)  const;
    uint4	          wholelength() const; // including _length member
    uint4	          length() const;      // excluding _length member
    uint4	          set_length(uint4 l); // of _opaque part only
    void	          ntoh();              // put in host byte-order
    void	          hton();              // put in net byte-order
    bool	          is_aligned() const; // to sizeof(int)
};

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.9">VOTING</A></H1>
<P>
<P>
The Shore storage manager implements the
&quot;read-only optimization&quot; for presumed-abort.
If a prepared transaction did not log any 
updates, the transaction is committed at
the time it is prepared, and the vote 
returned indicates that the transaction thread
is read-only.  
Once the vote is communicated to the coordinator,
and the coordinator has recorded this vote on
stable storage, 
this thread of the global transaction can be omitted
from all further processing of the transaction.
<P>
The votes are
<tt>{vote_bad, vote_readonly, vote_abort, vote_commit}.</tt>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.10">CRASH RECOVERY</A></H1>
<P>
If the application (value-added server) should crash
during a two-phase commit,
a new application (representing the coordinator)
must run, and it must contact the Shore storage manager
in order to complete the two-phase-commit protocol.

<P>
If the application crashes before the prepare
is done the transaction thread is aborted.

<P>
If the application crashes during the first phase (after
the prepare is done, but before the vote is written
to stable storage,
the application must retry the prepare phase to get the vote
and resolve the transaction.

<P>
If a crash occurs during the second phase (after
the prepare is done and its vote is written to
stable storage, but before the transaction is resolved),
the application cannot always tell if the second phase
completed.  It is always safe to try again to 
complete the transaction thread.   If the transaction thread
is unknown to the Shore storage manager at this point,
the second phase completed.
<P>
In order to locate a prepared transaction after a crash,
the application calls
 <strong>recover_2pc.</strong>
If a prepared thread with the given global transaction identifier
is found, the (local) Shore transaction identifier is returned,
and the thread is attached.
The application can subsequently call
 <strong>commit_xct</strong>
or
 <strong>abort_xct.</strong>
<P>
The Boolean argument
 <em>mayblock</em>
indicates whether the application
considers it acceptable for the 
 <strong>recover_2pc</strong>
call to block (e.g., in the event
that it is awaiting connection to its internal coordinator).
<P>
After recovery after a crash, a value-added server may
discover what transactions were prepared and need recovery
by calling the two forms of
 <strong>query_prepared_xct</strong>.
The first call returns the number of such transactions.
With that information, the value-added server can allocate
memory in for storing the global transaction identifiers of the
prepared transactions.
The value-added server then invokes the second form of
 <strong>query_prepared_xct</strong>
to get a list of the global transaction identifiers, and
then recover the prepared transactions.
