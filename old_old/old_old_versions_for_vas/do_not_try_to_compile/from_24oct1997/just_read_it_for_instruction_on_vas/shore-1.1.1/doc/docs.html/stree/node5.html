The Main Program</A>
</H1>
<P>
The main program of our sample application is in
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:mainSRC">main.C</A>.
Most of the code should be clear to any experienced C++ programmer.
We will only concentrate on those statements that exercise Shore
features.
<P><A NAME="stree:init">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000000">
Initialization</A>
</H2>
<P>
Any program that interacts with Shore must call the static member function
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:initcall"><TT>Shore::init</TT></A>
exactly once before doing any Shore operations, to initialize the client-side
machinery.
It searches the command line (supplied by the first two arguments,
which are usually the same as the first two arguments to <TT>main</TT>)
for options specifically meaningful Shore
and removes them from <TT>argc</TT> and <TT>argv</TT>.
The forth argument to <TT>Shore::init</TT> is the name of an options file,
which can supply parameters, such as the size of the object cache.
It is a good idea to get the name of this file from the environment,
as indicated here, rather than wiring into the program.
If there is no value for <TT>STREE_RC</TT> specified in the environment,
the standard Unix library function <TT>getenv</TT> will return 0, and a
null fourth argument tells <TT>Shore::init</TT> to use reasonable defaults.
The third argument to <TT>Shore::init</TT> is the application name, which is
used to look up options in the option file.
A null argument (as shown here) tells <TT>Shore::init</TT> to use <TT>argv[0]</TT>.
For more details, consult the <A NAME="tex2html7"
 HREF="../man/init.oc.html"><EM>init(oc)</EM></A>
manual page.
<P>
Like many Shore interface functions, <TT>Shore::init</TT> returns a value of type
<TT>shrc</TT> (&quot;rc&quot; stands for &quot;return code&quot;).
The macro <TT>SH_DO</TT> is handy for calling functions that are not
expected to fail.
It evaluates its argument and verifies that the result is <TT>RCOK</TT>.
If not, it prints (on <TT>cerr</TT>) an error message and aborts the program.
For more details about errors, consult the
<A NAME="tex2html8"
 HREF="../man/errors.oc.html"><EM>errors(oc)</EM></A>
manual page.
<TT>SH_DO</TT> is described on the
<A NAME="tex2html9"
 HREF="../man/transaction.oc.html"><EM>transaction(oc)</EM></A>
manual page.
<P><A NAME="stree:transactions">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000000">
Transactions</A>
</H2>
<P>
Every Shore operation except <TT>Shore::init</TT> must be executed inside
a <A NAME="tex2html10"
 HREF="../man/transaction.oc.html"><EM>transaction</EM></A>.
A transaction groups a set of interactions with the database into a single
atomic unit.
Shore ensures that transactions running concurrently by multiple programs have
a net effect that is equivalent to running them one at a time.
(This property is called &quot;serializability&quot;).
Moreover, if a transaction should fail, Shore guarantees that all changes
to the database performed by the transaction are undone.
A program starts a transaction by invoking the macro
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:begintrans"><TT>SH_BEGIN_TRANSACTION</TT></A>.
Its argument is a variable of type <TT>shrc</TT>.
When the program has successfully completed all the actions in a transaction,
it invokes the parameterless macro
<TT>SH_COMMIT_TRANSACTION</TT>
to make all of its changes to the database permanent and to unlock
any database objects that Shore may have locked to ensure serializability.
In exceptional circumstances, Shore may reject the attempt to commit the
transaction.
Therefore, <TT>SH_COMMIT_TRANSACTION</TT> returns an <TT>shrc</TT> value.
Since we do not want to try any fancy recovery actions if
<TT>SH_COMMIT_TRANSACTION</TT>
fails in our application, we invoke it with <TT>SH_DO</TT>.
<P>
On occasion, an application program may discover that a transaction
cannot be completed for application-specific reasons.
In such occasions, the program can explicitly <EM>abort</EM> the transaction
by calling the macro
<TT>SH_ABORT_TRANSACTION(rc)</TT>,
where <TT>rc</TT> is a value of type <TT>shrc</TT>.
In addition to requesting Shore to undo all changes to persistent data
and release all locks, this macro performs a longjmp, returning control
to the statement following the most recently executed
<TT>SH_BEGIN_TRANSACTION</TT> and assigning the <TT>shrc</TT> value supplied to
<TT>SH_ABORT_TRANSACTION</TT> to the result parameter of
<TT>SH_BEGIN_TRANSACTION</TT>.
Since any transaction may be aborted in this manner, each call to
<TT>SH_BEGIN_TRANSACTION</TT>
should be followed by code that tests the resulting <TT>shrc</TT> and takes
corrective action if it is not <TT>RCOK</TT>.
The member function <TT>shrc::fatal</TT> prints an appropriate message and
aborts the program.
The macro <TT>SH_DO</TT> previously described behaves somewhat differently
if a transaction is active and an error is detected:
Instead of terminating the program, it invokes
<TT>SH_ABORT_TRANSACTION</TT>.
For more details about errors, consult the
<A NAME="tex2html11"
 HREF="../man/transaction.oc.html"><EM>transaction(oc)</EM></A>
manual page.
<P><A NAME="stree:registered">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000000">
Registered Objects</A>
</H2>
<P>
After beginning a transaction, our example program calls
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:initcall"><TT>Shore::chdir</TT></A>.
to go to directory <TT>stree</TT>.
<TT>Shore::chdir</TT> is similar to the <TT>chdir</TT> system call of Unix:
It alters the current Shore working directory.
Note that the program has two &quot;current working directories&quot;:
one that is applies to Unix system calls and one that applies to all
path names used in calls to Shore.
<P>
Like the Unix system call, <TT>Shore::chdir</TT> will fail if the the
directory does not exist.
In the case of our example program, <TT>Shore::chdir</TT> fails for this reason
the first time the program is run.
It recovers by creating the directory (using <TT>Shore::mkdir</TT>, which is
similar to the Unix function of that name), and reissues the
<TT>chdir</TT> request).
A failure of the first <TT>chdir</TT> operation for any other reason
is a catastrophic error.
Thus the program checks that the return code is either <TT>RCOK</TT> or
<TT>SH_NotFound</TT> and aborts the transaction otherwise.
<P>
When run for the first time, our example program also creates two
&quot;registered&quot; objects: an instance of <TT>SearchTree</TT>
registered under the path name <TT>stree/repository</TT>
and a pool named <TT>stree/pool</TT>.
The pool is used <A HREF="node5.html#stree:anonymous">later</A>
to allocate &quot;anonymous&quot; instances of
<TT>Word</TT> and <TT>Cite</TT>.
See
<A NAME="tex2html12"
 HREF="../overview/overview.html"><EM>An Overview of Shore</EM></A>
for more information about registered and anonymous objects and pools.
The <TT>SearchTree</TT> object is created by a form of the C++ <EM>new</EM>
operator applied to the class name <TT>SearchTree</TT> using C++
&quot;placement syntax&quot; to supply the path name and permission bits
for the new object.
If the operation should fail for any reason (such as permission denied),
it will cause an abort of the current transaction, returning control
to the statement following the most recent
<TT>SH_BEGIN_TRANSACTION</TT>.
Otherwise, a reference to the new object is assigned to the global variable
<TT>repository</TT>.
<P>
The creation of
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:createrepository">the pool <TT>nodes</TT></A>.
illustrates an alternative way of creating
a registered object.
The variable <TT>nodes</TT> is declared to have type <TT>Ref&lt;Pool&gt;</TT>, where
<TT>Pool</TT> is a pre-defined Shore type.
The class <TT>Ref&lt;T&gt;</TT>, for any <TT>T</TT>, has several static member
functions, such as <TT>create_registered</TT>,
<TT>create_anonymous</TT>, and <TT>create_pool</TT>.
Each one has parameters to supply a path name and protection mode,
as well as a result parameter to receive a reference to the created object.
In this case we call <TT>nodes.create_pool</TT> to create a new <TT>Pool</TT>
object.
(We could have written equivalently <TT>Ref&lt;Pool&gt;::create_pool</TT>).
Each of these functions returns an
<TT>shrc</TT> result to indicate success or failure.
<P>
The differing failure modes of these two ways of creating registered objects
illustrate a general design principle of Shore.
Many Shore operations are invoked implicitly.
Another example of an implicit operation is dereferencing a <TT>Ref&lt;T&gt;</TT> value.
When any of them fails (for example, if the reference is null or dangling),
Shore responds by aborting the current transaction.
If the program needs more precise control-in particular, if it wants a
chance to recover from the error-it must use an alternative interface
by explicitly calling a Shore function that yields a return code.
<P>
If the directory <TT>stree</TT> already exists, the program expects
to find existing registered objects <TT>stree/repository</TT> and
<TT>stree/pool</TT>.
Each reference class <TT>Ref&lt;T&gt;</TT> has a static member function <TT>lookup</TT>,
with a path-name input parameter and an output parameter of type <TT>Ref&lt;T&gt;</TT>.
This function looks for a registered object with the given name, and if
one is found, checks that its type (as indicated by data stored in the
database) matches <TT>T</TT>.
If both checks succeed, a reference to the object is returned in the result
parameter.
The initializations of <TT>repository</TT> and <TT>nodes</TT> illustrate
two ways of invoking this function.
<P>
Finally, the main program performs one of four operations depending on
a command-line switch.
It either adds one or more documents to the repository, looks up a word,
removes a document from the repository, or dumps all anonymous objects.
<P><A NAME="stree:anonymous">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00054000000000000000000">
Anonymous Objects</A>
</H2>
<P>
In a typical Shore application, the vast majority of objects created will
not have path names.
Unlike registered objects, which can be accessed either by path name or
by references from other objects, these &quot;anonymous&quot; objects can
only be accessed by following references.
To assist in clustering, and to allow the application (and system
administrators) to keep track of all allocated space, Shore requires
each anonymous object to be allocated from a <EM>pool</EM>, which is a registered
object.
Our example program uses just one pool for all anonymous objects.
A more sophisticated program might use a separate pool for each type extent,
or for each major component of a complex data structure.
<P>
The function
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:searchtreeinsertFUNC"><TT>SearchTree::insert(char *fname)</TT></A>
in
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:treeSRC">tree.C</A>
shows how
to create anonymous objects.
The expression &quot;<TT>new (nodes) Cite</TT>&quot; allocates a new instance of
interface <TT>Cite</TT> from the pool referenced by <TT>nodes</TT>.
The function
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:documentfinalizeFUNC"><TT>Document::finalize(char *fname)</TT></A>
in
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:documentSRC">document.C</A>
shows how to destroy
an anonymous object:
If <TT>p</TT> is a reference (an instance of <TT>Ref&lt;T&gt;</TT>, for some type <TT>T</TT>),
<TT>p.destroy()</TT> destroys the object referenced by <TT>p</TT>.
Registered objects cannot be explicitly destroyed;
like Unix files, they are deleted by the system when they have no path names
designating them.
An example of code to delete a registered object may be found in
the function
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:deletefilesFUNC"><TT>delete_file</TT></A>
in
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:mainSRC">main.C</A>
The call <TT>Shore::unlink(fname)</TT> removes the name <TT>fname</TT> from a
registered object.
Since this object will not have any aliases (&quot;hard&quot; links, which are
created by <TT>Shore::link</TT>), unlinking it will cause it to be destroyed.
<P><A NAME="stree:relationships">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00055000000000000000000">
Relationships</A>
</H2>
<P>
The definitions in <TT>stree.sdl</TT> include two bidirectional relationships.
One links words to their citations and the other links citations to the
documents they cite.
A bidirectional relationship has two names, one for each direction.
For example, the relationship between citations and documents is called
&quot;<TT>doc</TT>&quot; in the <TT>Cite</TT>-to-<TT>Document</TT> direction and
&quot;<TT>cited_by</TT>&quot; in the reverse direction.
This relationship is declared by the declaration
<PRE>
    relationship ref&lt;Document&gt; doc inverse cited_by;
</PRE>
in interface <TT>Cite</TT>, and by the declaration
<PRE>
    relationship set&lt;Cite&gt; cited_by inverse doc;
</PRE>
in interface <TT>Document</TT>.
The SDL compiler checks that the two declarations are consistent.
The use of &quot;<TT>ref</TT>&quot; rather than &quot;<TT>set</TT>&quot; in the
first of these declarations indicates a functional dependency from
<TT>Cite</TT> to <TT>Document</TT>: Each <TT>Cite</TT> is related to at most
one <TT>Document</TT>.
<P>
In the C++ binding, these declarations give rise to data members
<TT>Cite::doc</TT>, of type <TT>Ref&lt;Document&gt;</TT> and
<TT>Document::cited_by</TT>, of type <TT>Set&lt;Cite&gt;</TT>.
Similarly, the relationship between words and citations is represented
by <TT>Word::cited_by</TT> and <TT>Cite::cites</TT>.
<P>
The type <TT>Set&lt;T&gt;</TT> represents a set of zero or more references to distinct
<TT>T</TT> objects.
It has member functions to add and delete values of type <TT>Ref&lt;Cite&gt;</TT>
and to iterate through its contents.
The details of the interface, which are documented in the
<A NAME="tex2html13"
 HREF="../man/set.cxxlb.html"><EM>set(cxxlb)</EM></A>
manual page,
are likely to change in future releases of Shore.
An example of the use of the current interface may be seen in
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:wordSRC">word.C</A>.
In
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:wordoccursonFUNC"><TT>Word::occurs_on</TT></A>,
a citation of word <TT>w</TT> is recorded by
adding the reference <TT>cite</TT> to <TT>w.cited_by</TT>.
The runtime support automatically adds a reference to <TT>w</TT> to
<TT>cite-&gt;cites</TT>.
The function
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:wordoccurrenceFUNC"><TT>Word::occurrence</TT></A>
uses the member function
<TT>Set&lt;Cite&gt;::get_elt</TT> to retrieve (a reference to) one of the citations
of a word, while <TT>Word::count</TT> uses
<TT>Set&lt;Cite&gt;::get_size</TT> to determine how many citations there are.
A reference can be deleted from a set with <TT>Set&lt;T&gt;::del</TT>.
<TT>Document::finalize</TT> uses an alternative interface:
The function <TT>Set&lt;T&gt;::delete_one</TT> returns a one of the references,
deleting it from the set.
(The implementation chooses an arbitrary reference to return; it retuns
<TT>NULL</TT> if the set is empty).
<P>
The function <TT>Document::finalize</TT> is called just before destroying a
<TT>Document</TT> object.
Although the runtime system automatically updates one end of an bidirectional
relationship when the other end is updated by assignment,
it does not (yet) update inverse relationships properly when an object
is destroyed.
(This is a bug; it will be fixed in a future release).
However, even if it did so, there might be application-specific cleanup
operations required.
In our example program, we would like to &quot;garbage collect&quot;
the <TT>Cite</TT> objects associated with the document being removed.
<TT>Document::finalize</TT> iterates through the citations of the document,
invoking <TT>Cite::finalize</TT> on each one and then destroying it.
<TT>Cite::finalize</TT> simply removes all references from the citation to
<TT>Word</TT> objects, thereby removing the citation from the <TT>cited_by</TT>
set of each word.
The example program does not remove words from
the binary search tree when their citation counts drop to zero.
<A NAME="stree:lazy">&#160;</A> Adding code to do so would not be hard, but
it would not illustrate any additional features of Shore.
<P><A NAME="stree:strings">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00056000000000000000000">
Strings and Text</A>
</H2>
<P>
The pre-defined type <TT>string</TT> is implemented as a <TT>char *</TT> pointer
and a length (so strings can contain null bytes).
When a persistent object containing strings is written to disk, the actual
string data is appended to the object and the pointers are converted to a
form appropriate for storage on disk.
When it is brought back into memory, the pointers are restored
(&quot;swizzled&quot;) to memory addresses.
When an ordinary C++ (null-terminated) string is assigned to a Shore
string, the bytes (up to and including the terminating null byte)
are copied to dynamically allocated space.
See for example,
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:wordinitializeFUNC"><TT>Word::initialize</TT></A>.
When an object containing strings is removed from the object cache, its
string space is freed.
Thus Shore strings have value semantics.
<P>
Standard library string functions such as <TT>strcmp</TT>, <TT>strncmp</TT>,
<TT>strlen</TT>, etc., as well as <TT>memcpy</TT> and <TT>bcopy</TT>
are overloaded to work with Shore strings.
In addition to <TT>strlen</TT>, strings support an operation <TT>blen</TT>
which returns the total length (including null bytes).
It is also possible to assign a character or string to an arbitrary
offset in a Shore string.
The target string is expanded if necessary to accommodate the data.
For example,
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:documentappendFUNC"><TT>Document::append</TT></A>
extends the <TT>body</TT> field of a
document by invoking the <TT>sdl_string::set</TT> function
(<TT>Document::body</TT> is actually of type <TT>text</TT>, but <TT>text</TT> and
<TT>string</TT> are the same for the purposes of this discussion).
See the
<A NAME="tex2html14"
 HREF="../man/string.cxxlb.html"><EM>string(cxxlb)</EM></A>
manual page for more details.
<P><A NAME="stree:pools">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00057000000000000000000">
Scanning Pools</A>
</H2>
<P>
The example program supports an option (-p) for dumping all the
anonymous objects in the <TT>pool</TT> created by the program.
This last option is useful for verifying that the object deletion code is
working correctly, and illustrates how one might write administrative programs
for maintaining a complex database.
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:poollistFUNC"><TT>pool_list</TT></A>
in
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:mainSRC">main.C</A>
creates a <TT>PoolScan</TT> object
to scan the contents of the pool, and tests whether the creation was
successful.  (If for example, the named pool did not exist or permission was
denied, the <TT>scan</TT> object would be created in an &quot;invalid&quot; state,
and would test as <EM>false</EM> when converted to Boolean.)
The function <TT>PoolScan::next</TT> returns a reference to the &quot;next&quot;
object in the pool (according to some arbitrary ordering) in its result
parameter.
It returns some <TT>shrc</TT> value other than <TT>RCOK</TT>
when no more objects remain.
The result parameter must be of type <TT>Ref&lt;any&gt;</TT>, the persistent analogue
of <TT>void *</TT> (a reference to an object of unknown type).
The actual type of object can be tested dynamically with the function
<TT>TYPE(T)::isa(Ref&lt;any&gt; &amp;ref)</TT>.
Each interface <TT>T</TT> defined in an SDL definition gives rise to a
<EM>type object</EM> (or <EM>meta-type</EM>), which is available as a
global variable named <TT>TYPE_OBJECT(T)</TT> (of type <TT>TYPE(T)</TT>).
One of the member functions of this object is <TT>isa</TT>, which accepts
a parameter of type <TT>Ref&lt;any&gt;</TT>, tests whether it is a reference to
an object of type <TT>T</TT>, and if so returns a reference of type <TT>Ref&lt;T&gt;</TT>
to it.
Otherwise, <TT>isa</TT> returns a null reference.
It should be noted that this interface for dynamic type checking is
provisional;
it may be replaced with a facility more nearly resembling the <TT>dynamic_cast</TT>
syntax for run-time type identification (RTTI) recently added to the proposed
C++ standard.
<P>
After checking that the type of returned object conforms to one of the expected
types (the program only creates anonymous objects of type <TT>Word</TT>
and <TT>Cite</TT>), <TT>pool_list</TT> uses the reference (as converted by
<TT>isa</TT>) to call the
appropriate print function (<TT>Word::print</TT> or <TT>Cite::print</TT>).
