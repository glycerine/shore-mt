<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.2">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
This is a class for collecting and printing
simple statistics,
meaning integers, unsigned integers, and
one-word floating-point numbers.
Statistics are collected in modules (meant
to correspond to software modules).
Each module consists of a list of 
statistics, along with metadata describing
the type and semantics of each statistic.
Modules are distinguished by unique masks,
which are manifest constants.
(There is no convenient way to make sure the
masks are unique.)
<P>
In order to reduce the effort required
to read this manual page, we distinguish
two kinds of readers:
those writing software that generates statistics
(e.g., a value-added-server),
and those writing software that uses statistics
generated elsewhere (e.g., an application that
uses statistics generated by the Shore Object Cache).
After reading the section below, 
 <strong>MECHANISM</strong>,
you can skip a section that does not apply to you.
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.3">MECHANISM</A></H1>
<P>
This class allows local and remote statistics to be collected.
In the local case, the  
modules in an instance of
 <em>w_statistics_t</em>
store references to data structures that are
updated 
<em>in place</em>
by the software module that generates the statistics.
For example, Object Cache statistics are
generated by the Object Cache, and are stored in a data structure 
to which the application's
 <em>w_statistics_t</em>
instance has direct access through a 
<tt>const</tt>
reference.
<P>
In the remote case, copies of the statistics and all their
metadata are put in the
 <em>w_statistics_t</em>
instance.
The implications of this are
that it can be confusing to copy and save statistics,
because local (static)  statistics and remote (malloc-ed)
statistics have to be treated differently.
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.4">WRITING SOFTWARE THAT GENERATES STATISTICS</A></H1>
<P>
In Shore, we use a Perl script (in
the source tree under 
<tt>tools/stats.pl,</tt>
)
to generate the statistics modules for the 
various software modules.
The section 
 <strong>GENERATING MODULES</strong>,
below describes the input to this script.
<P>
Any number of software modules can `add' their statistics 
to a 
 <em>w_statistics_t</em>
instance for later printing by an application.
The application can use generic methods to 
print the entire set of modules,
or it can print only selected statistics
according to its own formatting rules,
or use selected statistics for its own purposes.
<H2><A NAME="HRR.4.1">GENERATING MODULES </A></H2>
<P>
We use an (abbreviated) example from the Shore source tree 
to show how to use the Perls script
<tt>stats.pl</tt>
to generate statistics modules.
The input to the Perl script is as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
SM Storage manager = 0x00060000 sm_stats_info_t {
    // Record pinning:
    u_long rec_pin_cnt  Times records were pinned in the buffer pool
    u_long rec_unpin_cnt Times records were unpinned

    // Btree stats:
    u_long bt_find_cnt  Btree lookups (find_assoc())
    u_long bt_insert_cnt    Btree inserts (create_assoc)
    u_long bt_remove_cnt    Btree removes (destroy_assoc)
    u_long bt_scan_cnt      Btree scans started
    // ... we don't include all the stats
};
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first line identifies the module and some of the
metadata to be associated with it.
 <em>SM</em>
is a character string that will be a prefix for all
the manifest constants generated by the script.
What lies between 
 <em>SM</em>
and the equal sign (=)
becomes a descriptive string for the module, for 
the purpose of printing the statistics.
 <em>0x00060000</em>
is for distinguishing this module from others.
 <em>sm_stats_info_t</em>
is the name of a C++ class that 
&quot;owns&quot; the statistics.
This name is used to generate the file names
for the output of 
<tt>stats.pl.</tt>
The files generated in this example are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
sm_stats_info_t_def.i
sm_stats_info_t_msg.i
sm_stats_info_t_op.i
sm_stats_info_t_struct.i
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The second line is a comment.  C++ and C comments,
and blank lines are acceptable.
<P>
The next lines defines a single statistic,
whose type is
 <em>u_long.</em>
Types can be any one of :
<strong>long,  u_long, int, u_int, float.</strong>
After the type is a C/C++ struct member name.
The class 
 <em>sm_stats_info_t</em>
will contain the members
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
unsigned long rec_pin_cnt;
unsigned long rec_unpin_cnt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
and so on.
The list of members is generated by the script,
and will be found in 
<tt>sm_stats_info_t_struct.i.</tt>
The script does not generate the entire definition
for 
 <em>sm_stats_info_t</em>
because the author of the software may wish to make
the statistics be only a small part of the 
class, and therefore define the class as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
class sm_stats_info_t {
    ... // stuff

#include &quot;sm_stats_info_t_struct.i&quot;

    ... // more stuff
};
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Getting back to the input to the Perl script,
the remainder of the third line is a string
that describes the semantics of the statistic.
It will be quoted by the Perl script.  You should
not quote it in your input file.
The string should not be very long because
it makes the output difficult to format nicely.
<P>
The file
<tt>sm_stats_info_t_op.i</tt>
contains the definition of an output operator 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t &amp;
operator&lt;&lt;(w_statistics_t &amp;s,const sm_stats_info_t &amp;t);
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This operator is declared to be a friend of your
class 
 <em>sm_stats_info_t</em>
(by including
 <tt>sm_stats_info_t_struct.i</tt>.)
The file 
<tt>sm_stats_info_t_op.i</tt>
also contains some metadata describing the types of the
statistics, which are members of your class
(by including 
 <tt>sm_stats_info_t_struct.i</tt>.)
<P>
The file
<tt>sm_stats_info_t_msg.i</tt>
contains the list of descriptive strings for the module.
These must be used as follows (sorry, this
isn't automatically generated):
in some single place (so it isn't multiply defined), do
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
// the strings:
const char *sm_stats_info_t ::stat_names[] = {

#include &quot;sm_stats_info_t_msg.i&quot;

};
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The output file
<tt>sm_stats_info_t_def.i</tt>
contains the manifest constants for the module,
which are generated for (optional) use by
the application (the program that prints
the statistics).
<H2><A NAME="HRR.4.2">GATHERING STATISTICS</A></H2>
<P>
Using the above example, 
the module of statistics called a
 <em>sm_stats_info_t</em>
is added to a
 <em>w_statistics_t</em>
instance with the operator
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t &amp;
operator&lt;&lt;(w_statistics_t &amp;s,const sm_stats_info_t &amp;t)
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t stats;
// assume the sm_stats_info_t is called ss_m::stats_info

stats &lt;&lt; ss_m::stats_info;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.4.3">MISCELLANEOUS METHODS</A></H2>
<P>
 <strong>Copy_brief</strong>
makes copies of the statistics, but copies pointers to the
metadata.
The result is mutable.
<P>
 <strong>Copy_all</strong>
makes copies of the statistics and the metadata.
The result is mutable.
<P>
The methods
 <strong>int_val</strong>
 <strong>uint_val,</strong>
and
 <strong>float_val</strong>
return the integer, unsigned integer, or floating
point value of the statistic.
When an error occurs in evaluating the method,
these functions return 
 <em>error_int,</em>
 <em>error_uint,</em>
and
 <em>error_float,</em>
respectively.
You can find out the type of a statistic with the
method
 <strong>typechar,</strong>
which returns 'v' for unsigned longs,
'l' for longs, 'i' for ints, 'u' for unsigned ints,
and 'f' for floats.
<P>
 <strong>String</strong>
returns the printable, descriptive
string for the statistic indicated
by the manifest (named) constant.
 <strong>Module</strong>
returns the printable, descriptive
string for the module of which the
statistic is a member.
<P>
Operators 
 <strong>operator+=</strong>
and
 <strong>operator-=</strong>
perform the indicated arithmetic on
the corresponding statistics in the
operands, which are instances
of 
 <em>w_statistics_t.</em>
The operands must contain exactly the
same statistics,
and left-hand operand must be mutable,
which means that it must be a copy of a local (static)
instance, or it must be a remote (malloced) instance.
<P>
 <strong>Zero</strong>
sets all the values to 0 (or 0.0 for floats).
It will fail on an immutable (static, local)
instance.
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.5">WRITING SOFTWARE THAT USES GENERATED STATISTICS</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.5.1">GATHERING STATISTICS</A></H2>
<P>
Applications (users of SDL) will use
the method
 <strong>Shore::gather_stats.</strong>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t      localstats;
SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(localstats));

w_statistics_t      remotestats;
SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(remotestats, true));
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.5.2">PRINTING ALL THE STATISTICS</A></H2>
<P>
A program can use the output operator
<tt>ostream  &amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;out, const w_statistics_t &amp;s)</tt>
to print all the statistics in an instance of 
the class
 <em>w_statistics_t.</em>
The program does not need to have any compiled-in
knowledge of any of the modules contained in the 
instance.
<P>
<em>This operator does not print any information about statistics whose values are zero.</em>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t     stats;
<!-- ...  -->
cout &lt;&lt; stats &lt;&lt; endl;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HRR.6">PRINTING SELECTED STATISTICS</A></H1>
<P>
In order to use selected statistics,
a program must have compiled in the
manifest constants for the modules of interest.
For SDL users, these are included by
<TT>#include &lt;ShoreStats.h&gt;</TT>
See the following man pages for 
lists of the constants available for the various
software layers:
<A HREF="statistics.oc.html"><STRONG>statistics(oc)</STRONG></A>,
<A HREF="statistics.svas.html"><STRONG>statistics(svas)</STRONG></A>,
and
<A HREF="statistics.ssm.html"><STRONG>statistics(ssm)</STRONG></A>.
<P>
For example, to print the storage manager's
count of the bytes of log generated:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t    current;
SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(current, true));

cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Module &quot;
    &lt;&lt; current.module(SM_log_bytes_generated) &lt;&lt; endl;

cout &lt;&lt; ::form(&quot;\t%-30.30s %10.10d&quot;,
    current.string(SM_log_bytes_generated),
    current.int_val(SM_log_bytes_generated)) &lt;&lt; endl;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The first print statement prints the name of the module; you can
call the method
 <strong>w_statistics_t::module</strong>
with the manifest constant for any statistic
to get a descriptive name of the module (in this case, &quot;Storage manager&quot;).
The second print statement formats
the output as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
		Bytes written to the log       0000000928
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.6.1">SAVING STATISTICS and COMPUTING DIFFERENCES</A></H2>
<P>
Statistics can be saved for later use in 
computing the costs of certain operations.
The natural thing to want to do is to gather two
entirely different copies of all the statistics,
you can just gather twice, and compute the difference:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t      earlier;
SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(earlier, true));
<!-- ...  -->
w_statistics_t      later;
SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(later, true));

// DON'T DO THIS WITH LOCAL STATISICS
later -= earlier;
cout &lt;&lt; later &lt;&lt; endl;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.6.2">With local statistics ...</A></H2>
<P>
This will not work for local statistics
because the differences will always be zero!
Each of the instances of
 <em>w_statistics_t</em>
points directly to the current local statistics
data structures for each module!
It works fine for remote statistics (those gathered
from the Shore server) because each of
 <em>earlier</em>
and
 <em>later</em>
is a complete copy of the statistics and metadata.
<P>
To save local statistics, you need to make a copy.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
w_statistics_t      current;

SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(current));
w_statistics_t         *saved = current.copy_brief();
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <strong>Copy_brief</strong>
copies only that values of the statistics, and it
makes duplicate references to the metadata stored in
 <em>current</em>
(rather than copying all the descriptive strings, for example).
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
This means that you had better not let 
 <em>current</em>
go out of scope until you are finished with
 <em>saved</em>!
Now, you'd like to just
subtract one from the other:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
// ERROR:
current -= *saved;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
but that doesn't work because current is immutable.
(Remember, it points into the current statistics.)
You have to copy it also:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
// OK:
w_statistics_t *cur = current.copy_brief();
*cur -= saved;
cout &lt;&lt; *cur &lt;&lt; endl;
// Don't forget to delete:
delete cur;
delete saved;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.6.3">More about remote statistics ...</A></H2>
<P>
With remote statistics, you might wonder how you
can save the expense of twice copying all the metadata
from the server.
Here's how:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
w_statistics_t      current;
w_statistics_t      *saved;

SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(current, true));
w_statistics_t         *saved = current.copy_brief();
<!-- ...  -->
// gather a current set 
SH_DO(Shore::gather_stats(current, true));
current -= *saved;
cout &lt;&lt; current &lt;&lt; endl;
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
In this example, because 
 <em>current</em>
contains remote statistics (everything is malloced),
it is a writable instance of
 <em>w_statistics_t;</em>
it can be overwritten and updated by the subtraction.
