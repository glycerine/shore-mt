Using Indexes</A>
</H1>
<P>
As mentioned
<A HREF="node2.html#stree:examplenongoals">above</A>,
a binary search tree is not really an appropriate data structure for
persistent data.
Shore has a built-in index feature designed just for tasks such as this.
The <TT>src/examples/stree</TT> sub-directory of the distribution contains
a version of the search-trees example that uses a Shore index instead of
a search tree.
Instead of
<TT>stree.sdl</TT>
we use
<TT>doc_index.sdl</TT>.
The source file
<TT>stree_defs.C</TT>
is replaced by
<TT>doc_index_defs.C</TT>,
<TT>tree.C</TT>
is replaced by
<TT>docIndex.C</TT>,
and
<TT>main.C</TT>,
<TT>word.C</TT>,
<TT>cite.C</TT>,
and
<TT>document.C</TT>
are replaced by
<TT>ix_main.C</TT>,
<TT>ix_word.C</TT>,
<TT>ix_cite.C</TT>,
and
<TT>ix_document.C</TT>,
respectively.
Since most of the program is unchanged, we shall only consider the differences
here.
<P>
First consider <TT>doc_index.sdl</TT>.
We have removed from interface <TT>Word</TT> the attributes
<TT>left</TT> and <TT>right</TT> and operations <TT>find_or_add</TT> and <TT>find</TT>
and added a &quot;destructor&quot; named <TT>finalize</TT>.
The interface <TT>SearchTree</TT> has been renamed <TT>DocIndex</TT>.
Its attribute
<PRE>
    attribute ref&lt;Word&gt; root;
</PRE>
has been replaced by
<PRE>
    attribute index&lt;string,Word&gt; ind;
</PRE>
which declares an <EM>index</EM> mapping strings to <TT>Word</TT>
references.<A NAME="tex2html18"
 HREF="footnode.html#798"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../icons.gif/foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>
We have also added the operation <TT>delete_word</TT>, which we would have
included in <TT>SearchTree</TT> if we weren't so <A HREF="node5.html#stree:lazy">lazy</A>.
<P>
Each of the source files
<TT>main.C</TT>,
<TT>word.C</TT>,
<TT>cite.C</TT>,
and
<TT>document.C</TT>
has been edited to replace
<PRE>
    #include &quot;stree.h&quot;
</PRE>
with
<PRE>
    #include &quot;doc_index.h&quot;,
</PRE>
replace occurrences of type <TT>Ref&lt;SearchTree&gt;</TT> with <TT>Ref&lt;DocIndex&gt;</TT>,
etc.
The code in <TT>main.C</TT> for the-p option has been extended to
dump the contents of the index.
<TT>Word.C</TT> has been edited to remove all mention of the deleted attributes
<TT>left</TT> and <TT>right</TT> and operations <TT>find_or_add</TT> and <TT>find</TT>,
and a new <TT>finalize</TT> operation has been added, which simply calls
<TT>DocIndex::delete_word</TT>.
<P>
In <TT>cite.C</TT>, the <TT>finalize</TT> operation checks each <TT>Word</TT>
cited by the <TT>Cite</TT> being deleted to see if its
reference count has dropped to zero.
If so, it calls the <TT>Word</TT>'s <TT>finalize</TT> method and destroys it.
Note that the <TT>Word</TT> is first removed from <TT>Cite::cites</TT> relationship,
which also removes the current <TT>Cite</TT> from the inverse
<TT>Word::cited_by</TT> relationship, thus decrementing the <TT>Word</TT>'s
reference count.
<P>
The only change from
<TT>document.C</TT>
to
<TT>ix_document.C</TT>
the name of the <TT>#include</TT> file.
<P>
Finally, consider the new source file
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:docindexSRC"><TT>docIndex.C</TT></A>.
The <TT>index</TT> attribute <TT>ind</TT> of interface <TT>DocIndex</TT>
compiles into a data member whose type is derived from the pre-defined
Shore type <TT>sdl_index_base</TT>.
Each such index object must be initialized before it is used.
The &quot;constructor&quot; <TT>DocIndex::initialize</TT>
calls <TT>sdl_index_base::init</TT>, which takes a single argument
of type <TT>IndexKind</TT>-an enumeration type that includes the
values <TT>BTree</TT> and <TT>UniqueBtree</TT>.
(Other values of this enumeration correspond to index types that are
not yet supported.)
In our case, we choose <TT>UniqueBtree</TT>, meaning that we want a
B-tree that has at most one value for each key.
The member function <A HREF="node8.html#stree:docindexinsertFUNC">DocIndex::insert</A>
uses the member function
<TT>sdl_index_base::find</TT>
to determine whether a <TT>Word</TT> with the given key already exists in
the index.
If not, one is created and a reference to it is inserted into the index with
the member function
<TT>sdl_index_base::insert</TT>.
Finally, the <TT>Word</TT> object that was found or created is updated
to add the given <TT>Cite</TT> to its set of occurrences.
<P><TT>DocIndex::insert_file</TT> is identical to
<TT>SearchTree::insert_file</TT>, and
<TT>DocIndex::find</TT> simply calls
<TT>sdl_index_base::find</TT>.
<TT>DocIndex::delete_word</TT> is called to remove reference to a <TT>Word</TT>
from the index when it is no longer referenced.
The member function
<TT>sdl_index_base::remove</TT> has an input parameter of the key-type of the
index, and an integer output parameter <TT>count</TT>.
It removes all index entries whose keys match the first argument and
returns a count of the number of entries removed.
In our case, this count should always be one.
<P><TT>DocIndex::print</TT> illustrates how to iterate through the entries
in an index using the Shore template class <TT>IndexScanIter</TT>, which has
two type parameter corresponding to the types of the keys and values
of the index.
The types given must match the types of the language binding, which
might differ syntactically from the SDL type declarations.
(For example, <TT>Ref&lt;Word&gt;</TT> must be used in place of <TT>Word</TT> here, 
similarly
SDL <TT>string</TT> translates to <TT>sdl_string</TT> in a C++ language binding.)
<P>
The iterator's constructor takes an index of the appropriate type (in this
case <TT>DocIndex::ind</TT>) as a parameter.
For ordered indices (such as B-trees), it also has two optional arguments
to indicate lower and upper bounds.
When these values are supplied, the iterator only returns keys in the
indicated range.
When they are omitted (as in this example) the iterator
returns all entries in the index.
<P>
An iterator has a function member <TT>next</TT> to advance to
the next entry, a data member <TT>eof</TT> to indicate if any more entries
exist, and data members <TT>cur_key</TT> and <TT>cur_val</TT> representing
the key and value of the current entry.
As this code illustrates, the <TT>next</TT> function has to be called once
at the start to &quot;prime the pump&quot;, and <TT>eof</TT> flag is
false after advancing past the last entry.
This interface may change in future releases.
See the
<A NAME="tex2html19"
 HREF="../man/index.cxxlb.html"><EM>index(cxxlb)</EM></A>
manual page for more details.
<P>
The script <TT>run_tests.sh</TT> included in the source distribution runs
all of the tests listed above using both the <TT>stree</TT> and <TT>doc_index</TT>
versions of the program.
