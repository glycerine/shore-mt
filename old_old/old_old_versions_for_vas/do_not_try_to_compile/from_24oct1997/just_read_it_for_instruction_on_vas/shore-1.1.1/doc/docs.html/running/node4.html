</H2>
<P>
When the server starts, it locates its configuration
file and reads it.
The configuration option
<TT>svas_root</TT> gives a pathname in the Unix file system of a device or
file that is to serve as the root volume for Shore.
The default is <TT>./volumes/miniroot 10</TT>, which means that Shore will
use the Unix file <TT>./volumes/miniroot</TT>
to simulate a disk device.
(The &quot;<TT>10</TT>&quot; is an internal volume id to be assigned to this
volume by Shore).
Using Unix files to simulate disks is convenient for debugging, but
for better performance, you should replace this name with the pathname
of a real &quot;raw&quot; disk device (<TT>/dev/...</TT>).
One or more options <TT>svas_serve</TT> may also be present, indicating
other devices containing volumes to be served.
When you start from scratch, you have no root directory,
and you have to create one.
The server is able to run without a root directory,
but you can't do much with a server that has no
file system, other than use it to format devices
and make file systems (which correspond to volumes)
on those devices.
<P>
After reading the configuration file, the server normally starts a TCL
shell.
TCL (Tool Command Language) is a package originally written by John Ousterhout
at the University of California at Berkeley.
It consists of an interpreted language and an extensive support library,
including facilities for calling C function from TCL.
The main use of TCL in Shore is to provide an interactive command-line
interface to its components.
The TCL shell started by the SVAS reads a script of start-up commands and
then prompts for interactive input.
<P><A NAME="running:tcl">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000000">
TCL command file (option <TT>svas_shellrc</TT>)</A>
</H2>
<P>
One of the configuration options,
<TT>svas_tclshell</TT>, determines whether the server
will start a TCL shell.
If the value of <TT>svas_tclshell</TT> is <TT>yes</TT> or <TT>true</TT>,
a shell is started, and the option <TT>svas_shellrc</TT> is inspected.
(If the <TT>svas_tclshell</TT> option is not set by the configuration
file or a command-line option, its default value is <TT>true</TT>.)
If <TT>svas_shellrc</TT> is set, it names a file of <EM>TCL commands</EM>,
which are interpreted when the shell starts.
The default configuration file included with Shore sets this option to
<TT>&nbsp;/shore.rc</TT>.
If you followed the
<A HREF="../installation/node7.html#installation:running">installation instructions</A>,
you copied <TT>shore.rc</TT> from the installation directory
<TT>$SHORE/lib</TT> to your home directory.
This file of TCL commands is a convenience, not a requirement.
You may modify it or even remove it once you understand what it does.
<P>
The first time you run the SVAS, you are doing the Shore counterpart
of re-installing Unix.
The analogous activity in Unix is to
reformat your disks and install Unix from
scratch, making file systems with <TT>mkfs(8)</TT> or
<TT>newfs(8)</TT>).
There are enough steps to this process that you don't want
to have to do it by hand each time.
The script <TT>shore.rc</TT> automates this task.
It determines if the root file system was
mounted when the server started running.
If not, the TCL commands format the root volume and
create a Shore file system on it.
The commands also create several directories that are required by
the example applications.
<P>
Once your system is configured and running,
and you are in &quot;production mode&quot;,
you can dispense with this script.
As long as you don't intend to reformat your disks,
you can start a server without an TCL commands; all
you have to do in this case is to set the SVAS options
<TT>svas_root</TT> and
<TT>svas_serve</TT> so that the SVAS can mount the root
directory and other volumes.
On the other hand, it does not hurt anything to run the
server with a TCL shell and to have it read the TCL command
file each time it starts.
If you want to replace the file of TCL commands with your
own version, or if you want to avoid reading such a file
altogether, edit your options file <TT>.shoreconfig</TT>
and change or remove the command that sets the option
<TT>svas_shellrc</TT>.

<P>
If you followed the instruction for running the SVAS in
<A HREF="../installation/node7.html#installation:running">Running the Shore Server</A>,
you saw several messages looking like this:
<P><SMALL><PRE>
Warning: no database administrator -- running under userid 1417, groupid 1417

</SMALL>
<P>
You can ignore most of these messages.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>Warning: no database administrator ...</TT></STRONG>
<DD>announces that the server is not being run by the super-user, or
by the user
<TT>shoreadm</TT>.
<DT><STRONG><TT>Looking for run command file &quot;~/shore.rc&quot; ...</TT></STRONG>
<DD>If the server is configured to run a TCL shell (which it was),
and if it is given a file to read when the shell starts (<TT>shore.rc</TT>
in this case), it reads that file and interprets the commands therein.
Among the commands in <TT>shore.rc</TT> were commands to
format the device and volume for the root directory,
mount the root directory, and print the full object identifier
of the root directory.
<DT><STRONG><TT>format -./volumes/miniroot ...</TT></STRONG>
<DD><DT><STRONG><TT>mkfs ./volumes/miniroot ...</TT></STRONG>
<DD>The script checks whether the &quot;device&quot; <TT>./volumes/miniroot</TT>
exists.  If not it assumes that the device is really a Unix file,
which it creates and initializes to look like an empty file system by
issuing the commands
<PRE>
format ./volumes/miniroot 20000 true
mkfs ./volumes/miniroot 20000 10
</PRE>
The number 20000 is the size of the file created, in kilobytes.
If you want to use a raw device, you must change both the configuration option
<TT>svas_root</TT> in the configuration file <TT>.shoreconfig</TT>
and the variable <TT>rootvolumename</TT> in the startup file <TT>shore.rc</TT>.
Also the check to see whether the device exists will always succeed, so
you will have to run the <TT>format</TT> and <TT>mkfs</TT> commands
&quot;by hand&quot; the first time to format the device.
The second and subsequent times you run SVAS, these lines of output will be
replaced by
<PRE>
serve ./volumes/miniroot
</PRE>
meaning that the server has added this volume to the list of volumes for which
it will act as a server.
<P><DT><STRONG><TT>Shore Server ...</TT></STRONG>
<DD>After reading the file of TCL commands, the server's TCL shell
prints a welcome message and a prompt for TCL commands.
</DL>
<P>
The SVAS is now running a TCL shell in the window in which you
started the server. As you run clients, you can also run
TCL shell commands to the SVAS.
Unfortunately, this shell has no user guide, but is has some
on-line help. Type &quot;commands&quot; or &quot;help&quot;.
<P><A NAME="running:shutting">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00044000000000000000000">
Shutting the Server Down</A>
</H2>
<P>
The server shuts down when you type the command
<TT>bye</TT>, which is
synonymous with
<TT>quit, q, exit,</TT> and <TT>x</TT>.
You can also run the program
<TT>sshutdown</TT> directly from a Unix shell window.
This program contacts the server and causes it to shut down.
(This is the only way of cleanly shutting down the server if you ran it
without a TCL shell).
<P><A NAME="running:environment">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00045000000000000000000">
Changing Your Environment</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you want to change the location of your logs or
the location of your data volumes, you will need to edit
<TT>shore.rc</TT> (or whatever file you have
chosen as your file of TCL commands).
<EM>Warning: If your volumes or log are on a network file system (such as NFS
or AFS) rather than a local disk,
the server will be sluggish, and you must take care that
the volumes and logs have the necessary permissions so that
the user who runs the server can create and update the volumes and
log files.</EM>
<P>
The file of TCL commands does several things:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>It defines a table of volumes on which to create file systems
<DT>2.
<DD>It formats the volumes if necessary.
<B>Warning:
If your volumes are on a Unix raw device, you must do this step by hand.</B>
<DT>3.
<DD>It determines if the root directory was already mounted
when the configuration file was processed, and if not,
<DT>4.
<DD>It creates a file system (with the release, this
corresponds to a volume)
for the root of the Shore name space (&quot;/&quot;) ,
and mounts it,
<DT>5.
<DD>It mounts any non-root volumes
<DT>6.
<DD>It creates some directories and pools used by the example
applications, if they don't already exist.
</DL>
<P>
If you want to change the location or size
of your file system, look at the volume table
at the beginning of the file.
The comments there should be self-explanatory.
