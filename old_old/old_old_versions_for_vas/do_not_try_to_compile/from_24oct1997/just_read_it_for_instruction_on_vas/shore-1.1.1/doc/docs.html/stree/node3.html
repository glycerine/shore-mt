Defining Data Types</A>
</H1>
<P>
The first step in building an application to run under Shore is to define
the data types of all persistent data that will be used by the application.
These declarations are written in a type-definition language called SDL
(for <A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="../sdlman/sdlman.html"><EM>Shore Data-definition Language</EM></A>).
The file
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:sdlSRC">stree.sdl</A>
contains the type definitions for the binary search tree example.
This file contains one
<A HREF="../sdlman/node6.html#sdlman:module">module</A>,
called <TT>stree</TT>, which defines four types:
<TT>SearchTree</TT>,
<TT>Word</TT>,
<TT>Document</TT>,
and
<TT>Cite</TT>.
These types are defined by <EM>interface</EM> definitions, which are
quite similar to class definitions in C++.
<P><A HREF="node8.html#stree:searchtreeIF"><TT>SearchTree</TT></A>
is the top-level object.
The example program will create exactly one object of this type.
Its public interface consists of three operations:
<TT>initialize</TT>,
<TT>insert</TT>,
and
<TT>find</TT>.
It also defines one private operation, an alternate (overloaded)
version of <TT>insert</TT>, and one attribute, a <TT>ref</TT> (persistent
pointer) to the <TT>Word</TT> object that is the root of the tree.
The comments in
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:sdlSRC">stree.sdl</A>
explain the semantics of the operations
and attributes;
we will remark here only on aspects of the definition that illustrate
features of SDL.
<P>
The <TT>initialize</TT> operation of a <TT>SearchTree</TT> should be invoked
once immediately after it is created.
SDL does not yet have the counterpart of constructors and destructors
in C++.  (This deficiency may be rectified in a future version.)
The <TT>insert</TT> operation is intended to be invoked with one argument, which
is a (transient) C++ character string.  We use type
type <TT>lref&lt;char&gt;</TT>, which translates to <TT>char *</TT> in the C++ binding.
This is a bit of a kludge.  Future versions of SDL will probably have
a more general mechanism for declaring operations whose parameters have
&quot;opaque&quot; (i.e., non-SDL) types.
<P><A HREF="node8.html#stree:wordIF"><TT>Word</TT></A>
represents a node in the search tree.  The private part of
the interface is similar to the way one might define a binary search tree
node in C++ or C.  A <TT>Word</TT> has a string value and pointers to
its left and right subtrees.  The type <TT>string</TT> is a pre-defined
type in SDL representing an arbitrary-length character string.
The <TT>relationship</TT> declaration indicates that <TT>Word</TT>s participate
in an N-M (many-to-many) relationship with
<A HREF="node8.html#stree:citeIF"><TT>Cite</TT>s</A>.
That is, for each instance <TT>w</TT> of <TT>Word</TT>, <TT>w.cited_by</TT> is
a set of zero or more references to <TT>Cite</TT> objects.  Moreover,
<TT>Word::cited_by</TT> and <TT>Cite::cites</TT> are to be kept
<EM>consistent</EM>:
<TT>w.cited_by</TT> should contain a reference to an instance <TT>c</TT> of <TT>Cite</TT> if and only if <TT>c.cites</TT> contains a reference to <TT>w</TT>.
The operations <TT>find_or_add</TT> and <TT>find</TT> are intended only
to be called from the operations of <TT>SearchTree</TT>.  They would
be in the private part of the interface if SDL had the equivalent of the
<EM>friend</EM> declaration of C++.
<P>
A <A HREF="node8.html#stree:citeIF"><TT>Cite</TT></A>
object represents a citation (an occurrence of a word in
a line of a document).
The <TT>offset</TT> attribute indicates the offset of the cited line
from the beginning of the document, in bytes.
If SDL supported first class relationships in
the sense of the entity-relationship model-that is, if relationships
could have attributes-<TT>Cite</TT> would have been declared as a
relationship
between <TT>Word</TT> and <TT>Document</TT> with attribute <TT>offset</TT>.
Instead, a <EM>Cite</EM> is represented by a separate object, with a
many-to-many relationship to <TT>Word</TT> (each word may occur on many lines
and each line may cite several words) and a many-to-one relationship to
<TT>Documment</TT> (a document may have many lines, but each line cites a unique
document).
<P>
Finally,  <A HREF="node8.html#stree:documentIF"><TT>Document</TT></A>
represents an actual document stored in the repository.
The type <TT>text</TT> of the attribute <TT>body</TT> is the same as <TT>string</TT>,
but has the additional function of declaring that when a <TT>Document</TT>
is accessed through the Unix compatibility interface, it will appear to
be a file whose contents are the contents of this field.
