<P>
The 
<em>Shore return code</em>
class,
 <em>shrc,</em>
is a data structure that is fundamental
to all error-handling for Shore applications.
It is a pointer to a data structure that
contains an error code and a small stack trace
(limited to 3 levels) of the functions in which
the error was detected.
<P>
Most Shore functions return a
 <em>shrc.</em>
The include files for application programs
define a set of macros that are useful for
interpreting and using the
 <em>shrc.</em>
The macros are described in some detail in the
sections below.
They are summarized here:
<DL>
<DT>SH_DO(op)</DT><DD>
A macro that aborts the transaction if
the operator 
 <em>op</em>
returns an error.  See
<A HREF="transaction.oc.html"><STRONG>transaction(oc)</STRONG></A>
for details.
</DD>
<DT>SH_HANDLE_ERROR(op)</DT><DD>
Executes the operation
 <em>op</em>
and if an error is returned,
this macro calls the installed error handler
and exits.
See
<A HREF="errors.oc.html"><STRONG>errors(oc)</STRONG></A>
for details about installing an error handler.
</DD>
<DT>SH_HANDLE_NONFATAL_ERROR(op)</DT><DD>
This is the same as SH_HANDLE_ERROR except
that it does not exit after calling the installed
error handler.
</DD>
<DT>SH_NEW_ERROR_STACK(rc)</DT><DD>
This macro does not execute an operation;
rather, it is meant to be called after an 
operation has already returned,
and this macro manipulates the return code.
It creates a new
 <em>shrc</em>
containing the error code in
 <em>rc,</em>
but with a new stack trace
that contains only the line and file where
this macro is invoked.
Read on to see how this i used.
</DD>
<DT>SH_RETURN_ERROR(rc)</DT><DD>
If 
 <em>rc</em>
represents an error,
this macro adds stack trace information to 
 <em>rc.</em>
At most 3 lines of stack trace can be
stored in a
 <em>shrc</em>
structure.
<P>
</DD>
</DL>
The rest of this manual page describes 
some common errors
that application programs have to address
and some common programming errors.
These examples use the following macro (not
supplied in any of the Shore include files):
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#define PERROR(rc) { if(rc) {\
    cerr &lt;&lt; __LINE__ &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt;__FILE__&lt;&lt;&quot;:&quot;&lt;&lt;endl;\
    cerr &lt;&lt; rc &lt;&lt; endl; if(rc = RCOK);\
    } }
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="HRR.1.1">ERRORS IN new() and Ref<T>::new_persistent()</A></H2>
A major disadvantage of using the 
the C++ convention for creating
objects, namely the operator
 <strong>new,</strong>
is that there is no convenient way to deliver
error indications to the caller.
If a low-level error occurs during an attempt to 
create an object, an 
<em>error handler</em>
is called.
You can install your own error handler, or you can
use the default one.
In any case, the error handler function is
passed a 
 <em>shrc,</em>
which can be printed by the error handler;
unfortunately, it does not contain
the stack trace information describing the
code that called 
 <strong>new().</strong>
After the error handler is called, the 
program exits, because this is a fatal error
that cannot be cleanly handled. 
(If the class has virtual functions, 
C++ virtual function tables are created
after the space is allocated, which results
in an ungraceful error caused by dereferencing the 
<em>this</em>
null pointer.)
The following example illustrates an error occurrence in 
 <strong>new().</strong>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    char *fname = &quot;/nonexistentdir/junk&quot;;
    Ref&lt;SdlUnixFile&gt; o;
    o = new (fname, 0755) SdlUnixFile;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
results in the following message, printed by the 
default error handler, when 
<tt>/nonexistentdir</tt>
does not exist:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
1. error in ObjCache.C:3539 The named object was not found
        called from:
        0) OCRef.C:69
        1) ../../src/sdl/include/sdl_UnixFile.h:28
        2) in operator new():0
2. error in ObjCache.C:949 The requested object was not found
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The preferable way to create
objects, when an error might occur during their
creation, is with
 <strong>Ref&lt;T&gt;::new_persistent.</strong>
The following example shows how:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    char *fname = &quot;/nonexistentdir/junk&quot;;
    Ref&lt;SdlUnixFile&gt; o;
    rc = Ref&lt;SdlUnixFile&gt;::new_persistent(fname, 0755, o);
    SH_NEW_ERROR_STACK(rc);
    if(!o) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;Could not create &quot; &lt;&lt; fname  &lt;&lt; endl;
        PERROR(rc);
        ... perhaps abort the transaction
    }
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This results in the following message, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Could not create /nonexistentdir/junk
174 error.C:
1. error in error.C:171 The named object was not found
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.1.2">DEREFERENCING A BAD Ref<T></A></H2>
<P>
If a bad Ref&lt;T&gt; is dereferenced, and if the
lower layers can detect the problem in time (e.g.,
the reference is null), the error handler
will be called.
If the value of the reference is garbage, but
not null (perhaps a wayward pointer
resulted in scribbling on the reference), 
the lower layers will not detect
the bad reference, and your program will
behave in undefined ways
like any other program that uses a garbage pointer.
<P>
References are initialized to null, so that these
two statements are equivalent:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    Ref&lt;SdlUnixFile&gt; o(0);
    Ref&lt;SdlUnixFile&gt; o;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If the error handler is called during a dereference
(operator-&gt;), the program exits after calling the handler. 
If you are debugging a program  
that suffers this fate, you can use a debugger to 
break (stop) in the error handler, and see a full
stack trace that shows the source of the problem.
If you have not installed your own error handler,
set the breakpoint in 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    OCRef::default_error_handler
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="HRR.1.3">USING shrc TO GET STACK TRACES</A></H2>
<P>
When a
 <em>shrc</em>
is printed directly after 
returning from a method in the class
 <em>Shore,</em>
or 
from any low-level Shore library function,
the stack trace is of little use to you
if you don't care to look through the source
code for the Shore libraries.
You can use the macro
SH_NEW_ERROR_STACK to replace this stack trace
with a trace of the application functions in which
the error is detected,
or he can retain the low-level stack and attach
a new stack that traces the application functions in which
the error is detected,
The following example illustrates how the this is done.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
shrc
stat_it(const char *fname)
{
    shrc rc;
    rc = Shore::stat(fname, &amp;statbuf);
    SH_NEW_ERROR_STACK(rc);
    PERROR(rc); // prints rc, clears rc
    ...
    return rc;
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
In this example, when the application is handed a
return code from a method of 
 <em>class Shore</em>,
it checks the return code, and if appropriate,
it replaces the return code with a new one.
The new return-code's stack trace begins
with the line that creates the new return code.
<P>
The above code produces a message like this, if there
is no object with the name
 <em>fname:</em>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
1. error in error.C:35 The named object was not found
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If your application program has many levels of function
calls and you want the intermediate functions to add
stack trace information to the return code,
follow this example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
shrc
stat_it(const char *fname)
{
    shrc rc;
    rc = Shore::stat(fname, &amp;statbuf);
    SH_NEW_ERROR_STACK(rc);
    // leave rc intact, don't print
    return rc;
}

shrc
intermediate_func(const char *fname)
{
    shrc rc = stat_it(fname);
    ...
    // add stack trace info if error
    SH_RETURN_ERROR(rc);
}

main() {
    ...

    if (rc=intermediate_func(fname))  PERROR(rc);
    ...

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The above example yields error message like this,
if the caller of 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
1. error in error.C:46 The named object was not found
        called from:
        0) error.C:53
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The implementation of the
return code classes permits at most
3-level stacks of trace information.
<P>
Finally, if you would rather keep the entire
stack trace from lower layers, and you would
like to use your installed error handler (see below),
use the macro SH_HANDLE_NONFATAL_ERROR
or the macro
use the macro SH_HANDLE_ERROR
as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    SH_HANDLE_NONFATAL_ERROR(Shore::stat(fname, &amp;statbuf));
or
    SH_HANDLE_ERROR(Shore::stat(fname, &amp;statbuf));
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
both of which produce results like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
1. error in ObjCache.C:3539 The named object was not found
        called from:
        0) Shore.C:457
        1) error.C:62
2. error in ObjCache.C:1258 The requested object was not found
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The macro SH_HANDLE_NONFATAL_ERROR
 calls the installed error handler and
returns; SH_HANDLE_ERROR 
calls the installed error handler and exits.
If you have not installed an error handler, the
default error handler will be called.
See
<A HREF="errors.oc.html"><STRONG>errors(oc)</STRONG></A>
for information about installing an error handler.
<H2><A NAME="HRR.1.4">Error not checked</A></H2>
<P>
This message comes from the bowels of the
code that implements the 
 <em>shrc</em>
class.
It is printed if a 
<strong>shrc</strong>
is created, then
destroyed without ever having been
checked, for example
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
{ 
    shrc rc1 = RC(EINTR);
    shrc rc2 = RC(EINTR);
    if(rc2) { ... }
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
When the scope of
 <em>rc1</em>
is left,
the message will be printed.
When the scope of
 <em>rc2</em>
is left, no message will be printed because
 <em>rc2</em>
was checked.
<P>
You can locate the causes of these errors with
 <em>gdb</em>
by setting a breakpoint in
<strong>w_rc_t::error_not_checked ,</strong>
and printing a stack trace when the breakpoint is
reached.
<P>
If you try apply a non-const method
to a const reference, you will get
an error at compile-time.

<H2><A NAME="HRR.1.5">ACCESS PERMISSIONS</A></H2>
When
when the object in question is a registered object,
you can check your access rights for that object before
trying to use the object.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    int errno;

    SH_DO(Shore::access(fname, W_OK, errno));
    if(errno) {
        rc = RC(errno);
        SH_NEW_ERROR_STACK(rc);
        PERROR(rc);
    }

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
See 
<A HREF="access.oc.html"><STRONG>access(oc)</STRONG></A>
for details. 
The result of the above code is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
1. error in error.C:257 Permission denied
