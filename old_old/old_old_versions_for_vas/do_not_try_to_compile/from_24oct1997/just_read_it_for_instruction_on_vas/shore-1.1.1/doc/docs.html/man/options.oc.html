<H1><A NAME="HRR.2">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>

Each of the following options must appear on the command line
or in a configuration file.
On the command line, each option is prepended with a dash ('-');
in a configuration file, it is prepended by a 
<em>type,</em>
a 
<em>class,</em>
and a 
<em>program name</em>
 (in the style of X configuration options).

<P>
For applications,
the 
<em>type</em>
is &quot;shore&quot;,
and the 
<em>class</em>
and 
<em>program name</em>
are determined by the 
application.

<P>
For application processes,
the 
<em>type</em>
is &quot;shore&quot;,
the 
<em>class</em>
is &quot;client&quot;,
and 
<em>program name</em>
is determined by the application program
(an argument to 
 <strong>process_options</strong>
).

<P>
Wild cards &quot;?&quot; and &quot;*&quot; may be used as with X configuration options.
<P>
Examples are:

shore.client.uf.oc_pstats: yes
shore.client.?.oc_pstats: yes
*.client.*.oc_pstats: yes

<H1><A NAME="HRR.3">OBJECT CACHE OPTIONS</A></H1>

<P>
The following options are available to programs that use
the Shore language-independent library, which includes all
applications that use SDL.

<DL>
<DT>oc_mlimit</DT><DD>
Limit (in bytes) on the
size of of the object cache.
Default is 2 megabytes.

</DD>
<DT>oc_batch</DT><DD>
The number of update messages 
that can be collected before they are
sent to the server. -1 means that a 
heuristic is used.
Default is -1.

</DD>
<DT>oc_nobatch</DT><DD>
If set to true/yes, batching of updates 
is prevented.
Default is false/no.

</DD>
<DT>oc_prefetch</DT><DD>
If set to true/yes, all the objects
on a page are fetched into the object
cache when the server ships a page
to the client process.
If set to false/no, objects that
appear gratis are not read into the
object cache.
Pre-fetching only applies when the server
ships more than one object, which happens
only when the requested object is 
small (it does not consume the entire page)
and anonymous (all objects on the page
have the same ownership and permissions).
An application that makes sparse reads of a
large database might benefit by having this
set to false, but in most cases, it
pays to prefetch. 
Default is true/yes.

</DD>
<DT>oc_pstats</DT><DD>
If set to true/yes, 
the object cache prints statistics to the
standard output stream
every time a transaction is committed.
Default is false/no.

</DD>
<DT>oc_auditlevel</DT><DD>
This is a small positive integer.
The larger the integer, the more
auditing (debugging) code is run
in the object cache.
The largest meaningful value  is 5.
The default is 0.


</DD>
<DT>oc_pagecluster</DT><DD>
If set to true/yes, 
the object cache caches all objects on a page
when the server ships a whole page of objects.
(This happens only when the object requested is a small anonymous
object).
The default is &quot;yes&quot;.

</DD>
<DT>oc_refcount</DT><DD>
If set to true/yes, 
the object cache updates reference
counts to type objects (modules, really) 
when committing a transaction that created or destroyed instances.
For debugging purposes only.  Use with caution!  
If you create an object with reference-counting
turned off, and destroy it with reference-counting
turned on (or vice versa) the
results and the behavior of the system are undefined.
You can also cause problems by using reference counts
when creating objects, then destroying the objects
through NFS or by destroying a pool.
Default is false/no.
