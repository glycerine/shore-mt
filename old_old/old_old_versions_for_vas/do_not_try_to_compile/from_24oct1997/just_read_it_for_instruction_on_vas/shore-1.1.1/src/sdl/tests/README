This is a contrived example that uses
features of SDL and demonstrates the 
language binding and how to use it for
most features of SDL.

One purpose of this example is to help
the effort to document the C++ language
binding and the SDL syntax in the SDL
reference manual.

It is most explicitly not a goal for this
example to resemble a useful application.
