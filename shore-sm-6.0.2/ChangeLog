6.0.1-alpha: Mon May 24 10:15:01 MDT 2010

This is a major overhaul of the storage manager.

It is a port of the entire storage manager and its tests to true concurrent
pthreads. It no longer uses sthreads and its primitives. This release
is an extension of the 2009 SHORE-MT release.

Included are too many bug fixes and changes to enumerate them here.
The documentation is strictly html, built from the source files using
Doxygen; the .pdf files of prior releases are gone.

6.0.0-Beta: October 2010: Beta releases of the above.

6.0.0: December 2010: first non-beta release of the above.

6.0.1:  Minor changes: Updated hyper-refs to new UW web host; 
       makefile changes for maintenance purposes.

6.0.2:  Minor changes: 
       Minor compiler warning fixes.

	   Document problem with gcc4.4 (do not use: it has serious optimizer
	   bugs).

	   Updated comments in code.

	   Removed some obsolete code in btree implementation.

	   Removed need for gethostbyname() in ss_m::generate_new_lvid():
	     now generating a long volume id is thus:
		  1) an optional string argument is passed in for the host name
		  2) if null host name given, the following is used to get an IP4 
		  address:
		     2a) if uname() is present, use it, else
			 2b) if gethostname() is present, use it, else
			 2c) use "localhost.localdomain"
		  3) convert the host name string to an IP4 address thus:
		     3a) if gethostbyname() is present use it, else
			 3b) use getaddrinfo()
	    Generating the lower half of the long identifier now hashes a
		clock value.  If gettimeofday() is present, that is used to
		incorporate microseconds into the formula.

	    Documentation changes: fixed typos, updated to reflect above changes
		in generate_new_lvid().
