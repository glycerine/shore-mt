 *
 * This macro starts a critical section protected by the given lock

 * named by the 1st argument.
 * The rest of the scope (in which this macro is used) becomes the
 * scope of the critical section, since it is the destruction of this
 * critical_section structure that releases the lock.
 *
 * The programmer can release the lock early by calling \<name\>.pause()
 * or \<name\>.exit().
 * The programmer can reacquire the lock by calling \<name\>.resume() if
 * \<name\>.pause() was called, but not after \<name\>.exit().

 *   - applies the Release command upon destruction.
 *
 * pointer() is here for debugging: w_assert0(pointer()); can be
 * placed before ExtraInit or elsewhere. It was needed to track down
 * gcc44 optimizer bug, which had the symptom that it seemed that
 * the destructor for critical_section wasn't being called, when
 * in fact the problem was that the _mutex variable wasn't being set.
