/**\file lock_x.h
 *\ingroup Macros

 *
This file contains declarations for classes used in implementing
the association between locks and transactions.  The important
classes are:
    lock_request_t: a transaction's request for a lock. 
    lock_cache_t: cache of transactions recent requests
    xct_lock_info_t: lock information associated with a transaction 

This file also has hooks for the implmentation of "quarks".  Quarks are
a sub-transaction locking scope.  Opening a quark begins the scope.
While a quark is open all locks acquired are recorded.  When a quark is
closed, all SH/IS/UD locks acquired since the opening of the quark can
be released.  Requests for long-duration locks during a quark are
converted to short-duration requests.  If a lock was held before
a quark was opened, closing the quark will not release the lock.

Only one quark may be open at a time for a transaction.

Because short-duration locks are not cached, yet, obtaining
locks during a quark is slower.

The user interface for quarks is sm_quark_t defined in sm.h and
implemented in sm.cpp.  The sm_quark_t::open/close methods simply
call 
lock_core_m::open/close_quark where the real work is done.

Only minor data structure additions where needed.  lock_request_t
now has a constructor which takes a bool indicating that
the request is just a special marker for the opening of
a quark.  A marking added to the lock list in xct_lock_info_t
when a quark is opened.  xct_lock_info_t also has a pointer,
quark_marker, pointing to the marker if a quark is open,
and null otherwise.

/**\brief Structure representing a lock request
 * \details
 *
 * Lock requests are strung together into two lists.
 * When a lock request is in the lock table (whether granted or not),
 * it hangs off a lock_head_t list called _queue.
 *
 * Lock requests also sit in a list hanging off the transaction that
 * made the request; this is the xct_lock_info_t's my_req_list.
 *
 * These lists are protected by locks in the objects that hold the
 * lists.  The lock manager grabs a lock in the lock_head_t to
 * traverse the requests for that lock.

       bucket, acquire the lock->mutex, then decrement pin_cnt. Changes
       to pin_cnt must be atomic because it's not protected fully by
       any critical section.

       This lock can only be deallocated safely if request _queue is
       empty (as before) *AND* the pin_cnt is zero while a thread
       holds the bucket mutex -- any thread caught trying to add
       the request to the lock head's _queue will have the lock pinned; any
       thread that has already added the request will have unpinned the
       lock.

       Note that the lock head's chain is protected by the bucket the lock
       lives in, not the lock->head_mutex (because it's logically part of
       the bucket rather than the lock head)
