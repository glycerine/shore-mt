SHORE Storage Manager Release 6.0.2:
  - Minor documentation improvements, removal of dead code. 
  - Minor portability improvement: got rid of gethostbyname()
  - Bug fixes (by gnats number): 
     162) no-op in bf htab lookup
     165) deadlock detection bugs : was not taking into account incompatibility
	 between upgrade-mode of waiting request and the "current" request's modes, which could
	 result in interminable sleep, and
	 was not properly dealing with update-locks in deadlock detection.
	 166) incorporated some hash-function and deadlock-detection performance improvements per
	 suggestions from a user.
     174) memory management bug that could cause system to run out of
     memory with the type-specific heaps
	 172) btree traversal bug: removed a buggy optimization in re-traversing after
	 a posc
	 173)  btree performance improvement: avoids excessive heap use where items can
	 use the stack instead.

	   Paradise days
  - Rewrite of the buffer manager, deadlock detection, and significant
       portions of the volume manager.
