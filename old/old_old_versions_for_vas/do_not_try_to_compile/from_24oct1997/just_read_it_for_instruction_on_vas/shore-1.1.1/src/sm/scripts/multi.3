#
# This script demonstrates a bug which occurs
# when two threads try creating a file at the
# same time. The problem is that one thread holds
# a latch on the last log records, which the other
# thread deadlocks on.
#
# Depending upon optimization and DEBUG modes,
# 'ntries' may have to be increased to demonstrate
# the problem.
