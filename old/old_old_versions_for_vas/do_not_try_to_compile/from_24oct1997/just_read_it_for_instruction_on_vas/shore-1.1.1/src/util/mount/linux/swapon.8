.SH NAME
swapon, swapoff \- enable/disable devices and files for paging and swapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/swapon \-a
.br
.BI /etc/swapon " specialfile " ...

.B /etc/swapoff \-a

.BI /etc/swapoff " specialfile " ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Swapon
is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping are to take place.
Calls to
.B swapon
normally occur in the system multi-user initialization file
.I /etc/rc
making all swap devices available, so that the paging and swapping activity
is interleaved across several devices and files.

Normally, the first form is used:
.TP
.B \-a
All devices marked as ``sw'' swap devices in
.I /etc/fstab
are made available.
.PP
.B Swapoff
disables swapping on the specified devices and files, or on all swap
entries in
.I /etc/fstab
when the
.B \-a
flag is given.
