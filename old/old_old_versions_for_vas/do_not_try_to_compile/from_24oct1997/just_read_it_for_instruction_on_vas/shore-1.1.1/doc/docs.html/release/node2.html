What is the Shore Release?</A>
</H1>
<P>
Release 1.1.1 of the Shore software represents a bug-fix and
maintenance release relative to the previous release.
The release is targeted
for sites that will use Shore as a system for writing applications
using the Shore Data-definition Language and for those who
want to write their own servers using the Shore Storage Manager.
This document describes the release and provides pointers
to other documents explaining how to install and use the
software.
<P>

them to

Requirements</A>
</H2>
<P>
The Version 1.1.1  release of Shore is supported for 
Solaris 2.5 on SPARCstations and Intel X86 (Pentium) workstations
and Linux.
Shore has been ported to other platforms, but there are no supported ports
at this time.  We hope to make available, on an &quot;as is&quot; basis,
ports contributed by the user community.
<P>
You will need a current version of GNU C/C++ compiler <EM>gcc</EM> 
(with its include files) and the GNU <EM>make</EM>  utility.
We do not support other compilers or versions of <EM>make</EM> .
The current release builds successfully with versions
2.7.2.2 and 2.7.2.3 of the compiler.
The pre-compiled (binary) release was built with gcc 2.7.2.3 and libg++ 2.7.2.
As newer versions of the compiler are released, we will update the Shore
software.
<P>
Complete details about required software and hardware are available in
the <A HREF="../installation/node3.html#installation:requirements">Requirements section</A> of the
Installation manual.

What is New in Release 1.1.1</A>
</H2>
The Linux port has been brought up-to-date.
Changes were small but rather pervasive.
Recent releases have become more and more Solaris-specific.
These updates should make Shore easier to port to other platforms.
<P>
Numerous other small bugs, mostly concerned with compiling and installing
the software, have been repaired.
<P>
A rather obscure bug concerning SIX mode locking has been fixed in the
lock manager (src/sm/lock.cc).
<P>
The binary release was built with the latest GNU compilers: gcc (and g++)
version 2.7.2.3 and libg++ 2.7.2.

Maintenance Fixes</A>
</H3>
Numerous bug fixes and performance improvements have been made throughout
Shore, especially in the storage manager.
In particular,
<UL>
<LI>
Locks are automatically escalated from record to page to file level.
<LI>
Logging has been substantially improved to generate fewer log records.
<LI>
Bulk loading facilities have been improved.
<LI>
Allocation of space in files has been substantially improved.
<LI>
Numerous storage leaks and uninitialized variables discovered by
Purify<SUP><I>TM</I></SUP> have been fixed.
<LI>
More kinds of temporary files are available.
The semantics have been cleaned up and bugs in logging have been fixed.
<LI>
The concurrency control and recovery code for btrees has been extensively
revised more closely to follow Mohan's ARIES algorithms.
<LI>
Keys of all primitive types are now correctly handled (in a machine-independent
manner) for btrees and for sorting.
<LI>
The <TT>#include</TT> files in the storage manager have been reorganized
to reflect a cleaner layering and to improve compilation speed.
<LI>
Error messages from the <TT>diskrw</TT> process have been
made more intelligible.
<LI>
A great deal of obsolete code has been removed.
<LI>
Most of the documents have been substantially rewritten.
</UL><A NAME="release:new11:configuration">&#160;</A><H3><A NAME="SECTION00024200000000000000000">
Configuration</A>
</H3>
The system for configuring and building Shore from source has been
substantially streamlined.
We no longer use <TT>imake</TT> (from the X Window System) to generate
Makefiles.
Instead, Makefiles are generated from Imakefiles and configuration files
in the <TT>config</TT> directory by a Perl script.
In addition to eliminating the need to install <TT>imake</TT>, this change
makes configuration considerably easier to understand and modify.
Imakefiles and substantially shorter, and the generated Makefiles are 
both <EM>much</EM>  shorter (up to 5 times shorter) and formatted more
readably.
All local configuration settings related to compiling are confined to a single
file: <TT>config/config.h</TT>, and mostly to the first 160 or so lines.
The only runtime configuration necessary is a one-line change to a single
file (<TT>lib/options</TT>, which is normally installed as
<TT>~/.shoreconfig</TT>).

<LI> Applications linked with the no-debug
libraries must be recompiled with the no-debug include files,
because the two implementations of the return-code class
are incompatible.
<LI> Ref&lt;Pool&gt; can be used in applications.
<LI> Enumerations can be used for index key types.
<LI> Reference-counting on modules is enabled and under the control
of the option <TT>oc_refcount</TT>.
If you use this, use it with caution.

Storage manager</A>
</H3>
<P><UL>
<LI> The format of logs and volumes has changed; data created
under previous releases cannot be read by a Version 1.0 server.
<LI>
The SM programming interface is slightly changed to support
multi-threaded transactions 
(in limited circumstances: see <A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="../man/smthread_t.ssm.html">smthread_t(SSM)</A> ),
<P>
external two-phase commit (see
<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="../man/transaction.ssm.html">transaction(SSM)</A>),
and
faster record creation in a file in append-only context (see
<A NAME="tex2html4"
 HREF="../man/scan_file_i.ssm.html">scan_file_i(SSM)</A>
).
<LI> The log can be a raw device.
The SM can be configured to use a separate (diskrw) process
for the log or to perform the log I/O locally (and synchronously).
The SM layer has a new option <TT>sm_reformat_log</TT> to control reformatting the log,
in the event that a raw device is used.  The
meaning of the option <TT>sm_logsize</TT> has changed.
(See
<A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="../man/options.svas.html">options(SVAS)</A>
for details.)
<LI> More statistics are reported.
<LI> Miscellaneous performance improvements were made (logging
uninitialized data, append-only file population, store-descriptor
cache expands as needed, lock manager simplified).
<LI>
The programming interface for threads has changed.
The changes are incorporated into the example value-added
server, and described in the companion document.
