<H1><A NAME="HRR.2">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
Errors in the SSM are indicated by an unsigned integer
wrapped in a mechanism that includes stack
traces and other debugging aids.
The mechanism is the class
 <strong>w_rc_t</strong>
which is the return-type for most SSM methods.
<P>
The error codes return from SSM methods are:
