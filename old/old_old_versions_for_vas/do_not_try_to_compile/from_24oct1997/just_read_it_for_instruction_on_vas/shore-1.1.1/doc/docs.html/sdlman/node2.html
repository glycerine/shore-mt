Introduction</A>
</H1>
<P>
The Shore Data Language (SDL) is a language for specifying the types of
persistent objects.
Although the design of SDL is heavily influenced by C++, it is intended to
be independent of any particular target language.
Definitions written in SDL are compiled by the SDL compiler
(see the manual page
<A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="../man/sdl.sdl.html">sdl(sdl)</A>)
into objects stored in the database.
These objects are then used to generate data declarations appropriate
to a particular language, called a <EM>language binding</EM>.
(Currently, only a C++ language binding exists).
<P>
SDL is derived from and inspired by the object-definition language
ODL being developed by the Object Database Management Group (ODMG) as a proposed
standard for object-oriented databases.
At the time of this writing, the ODMG standard was not suitable for our
purposes.
That standard actually defines two languages.
ODL <EM>per se</EM> is a variant of the Interface Description Language (IDL)
defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) in connection with the
Common Request Object Broker (CORBA) standardization effort.
IDL is essentially a specification language for remote procedure call (RPC)
interfaces.
As such, it assumes complete encapsulation of objects.
For example, it provides no way to specify the public and private parts
of an object, since it is assumed that the private parts need not
be mentioned in the specification.
Thus an IDL (or ODL) specification does not have enough information to
determine the layout of the data in an object, or even its total size.
As such, it is inadequate for an &quot;object-shipping&quot; implementation
in which cached copies of objects are directly manipulated by application
programs.
Moreover, the ODL specification is currently incomplete.
While there is a (nearly) LALR grammar describing the syntax,
many of the constructs
have no semantics specified.
<P>
The ODMG specification also describes a specification language called
&quot;ODL-C++&quot;.
No syntax for this language is given.
Rather, it is described informally in terms of modifications of the
type-specification fragment of C++; some features are prohibited and a
few extensions are outlined.
This language does not meet Shore's needs for a language-independent
type specification language that would support access and manipulation of
a single database by application programs written in a variety of languages.
<P>
The Shore project continues to monitor the progress of the ODMG standardization
effort and hopes to reconcile SDL with ODL at some time in the future.
<P>
The current document is intended to be a reference manual rather than
a tutorial introduction to SDL.
See the document <A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="../stree/stree.html"><EM>Getting Started with Shore</EM></A>
for a detailed example that illustrates most of the features of SDL.
The manual page <A NAME="tex2html4"
 HREF="../man/intro.sdl.html">intro(sdl)</A> and other manual
pages cited there describe the C++ language binding for Shore in detail.
<P>
Features that are not supported in the current release of SDL are
<em>
indicated this way.
