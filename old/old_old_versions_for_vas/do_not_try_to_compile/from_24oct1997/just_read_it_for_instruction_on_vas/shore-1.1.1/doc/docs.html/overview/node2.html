Introduction</A>
</H1>
<P>
Shore (Scalable Heterogeneous Object REpository) is
a new persistent object system under development at the University of
Wisconsin that represents a merger of object-oriented database (OODB)
and file system technologies.  While the past few years have seen
significant progress in the OODB area, most
applications (and application areas) have not chosen to leave
file systems behind in favor of OODBs.  We feel that more applications could
benefit from OODB support, but are impeded by limitations in current
technology.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Many current OODBs are closed and restricted to one language (most
often persistent C++ or Smalltalk), unlike both file systems and relational
database systems. Large-scale applications often require multilingual
data access.
<DT>2.
<DD>With most current OODBs, application programmers face an ``either/or''
decision--either they put their data in the OODB, in which case all
of their existing file-based applications must be rewritten, or they
leave their data in files.
<P><DT>3.
<DD>Most current OODBs provide a fairly ``heavy'' solution in the area of
transaction management, dictating the adoption of serializability and
up-to-the-last-transaction data recoverability.
<P><DT>4.
<DD>Most current OODBs have strongly client-server architectures, and
are thus inappropriate for execution in peer-to-peer distributed systems
or on the kinds of high-performance multicomputer hardware needed for
certain large scale applications.
</DL>
<P>
The goal of the Shore project is to provide a system that addresses these
issues, thereby enabling ``holdout'' applications to finally move their data
(incrementally) out of files and into a modern persistent object repository.
We also expect many current OODB clients to find Shore to be an attractive
alternative.

<P>
Many of us were involved in an earlier object-oriented database effort
called <A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/p/exodus/html/exodus.home.html">EXODUS</A>
&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node7.html#cdfgmrs:the">CDF+86</A>].
<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/exodus">Version 3.0 of EXODUS</A>
provides a client-server architecture with
page-level locking,
log-based recovery based on the ARIES algorithm&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node7.html#fztcd:cra">FZT+92</A>], and support
for multiple servers and distributed transactions.
The EXODUS package includes the 
<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/exodus">E programming language</A>
&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node7.html#rcs:the">RCS93</A>], a
variant of C++ that supports convenient creation and manipulation of persistent
data structures.
The functionality,
performance, robustness, and low cost (free!)  of EXODUS has made it a popular
piece of software.  EXODUS and its associated toolkit have been used in
several projects at Wisconsin and elsewhere.  Over 350 different
groups from over 30 countries have taken copies of it from our ftp
site, it is used as the storage manager in the TI Open Object-Oriented
Database System, it serves as the storage engine for at least one
commercial product (MediaDB, a recently announced multi-media DBMS), and it has
been shown to have commercially competitive performance on an
OODBMS benchmark&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node7.html#cdn:the">CDN93</A>].
Nonetheless, EXODUS suffers from several limitations shared by many
current persistent object stores.
An exploration of these limitations may help to explain the motivation for
Shore.
EXODUS storage objects are untyped arrays of bytes;
correct interpretation of their contents is the responsibility of application
programs.  Although E allows instances of any C++ type to be stored in
the database, no type information is stored.  This ``compile-time'' approach
to data types has several disadvantages including the following:
<UL>
<LI> It is too easy to access objects under the wrong type, because of
programming or configuration errors such as version mismatch.
<LI> Restricting type support to the compiler locks users into single-language
solutions.
<LI> Sharing data between applications is difficult.
<LI> Lack of stored types prevents the DBMS from providing such facilities as
support for heterogeneous hardware platforms, data browsers, or garbage
collectors.
</UL>
At the time we designed EXODUS, we felt there was too much variability
in type systems to legislate a common solution.
Since then, there has been a growing
consensus on the level of type support that an OODBMS system should
provide&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node7.html#c:ods">Cat93</A>].
A second limitation of the EXODUS storage manager (ESM) is its
client-server architecture.  Users have constructed database servers
or object servers as EXODUS client processes, leading to the
``client-level server'' problem illustrated in
Figure <A HREF="node2.html#fig:clilev">1</A>.
Even a query-shipping (as opposed to
data-shipping) SQL server would be difficult construct efficiently with the
existing software base.  In contrast, a more open architecture would have
allowed clients to customize the ESM server process directly.
The ESM process architecture also fails to support a clean mapping onto
parallel processors such as the Intel Paragon or
IBM SP/2.  Although one could simply run an EXODUS server on each node
with mass storage attached, support for distributed transactions is not
sufficient; efficient parallelism also requires the availability of
extensive server-to-server communication facilities.

</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
A third limitation of EXODUS is its lack of support for access control.
As with other aspects of the system, our original thinking was that
different clients might wish to implement very different protection
models, and thus we provided no built-in protection support.
Furthermore, EXODUS allows client processes to manipulate objects
directly in cached copies of database pages, so an errant pointer can
destroy not only client data but also metadata, rendering the entire database
unusable.  The original design of EXODUS envisioned
client processes as being database systems and object servers (i.e.,
other trusted software layers).
Shore aims to support environments in which a single storage volume
may be shared by mutually mistrusting applications.
<P>
Finally, while EXODUS objects are similar to Unix files (they are untyped
sequences of bytes), the interface for manipulating them is completely
different.  As a result, existing applications built around
Unix files cannot easily use EXODUS.
<P>
The design of Shore strives to retain the good features of the
EXODUS Storage Manager (such as transactions, performance, and robustness) while
eliminating some of these limitations.
<P><A NAME="overview:differences">&#160;</A><H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000000">
How Shore differs from EXODUS</A>
</H2>
<P>
Each object in Shore contains a pointer to a <EM>type</EM> object that
defines its structure and interface.  
The 
Shore Data Language
provides a single
language-neutral notation for describing the types of all persistent
data<A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="footnode.html#307"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../icons.gif/foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>
<P>
Shore's process architecture is different from that of EXODUS in two
key ways.  First, Shore has a symmetric, peer-to-peer 
<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="footnode.html#52"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../icons.gif/foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A> 
structure.
Every participating processor runs a Shore server process regardless whether
it has local disks.  A client process interacts with Shore by communicating
with the local Shore server (see 
Figure <A HREF="node2.html#fig:shorearch">2</A>
).
The design is scalable; it can run on a single
processor, a network of workstations, or a large parallel processor
such as the Intel Paragon or IBM SP/2.  (For more on parallel Shore,
the reader is referred to [<A
 HREF="node7.html#dns:parset">DNSV94</A>]).
Second, Shore supports the notion
of a ``value-added'' server.  The server code is modularly constructed
to make it relatively
simple for users to build application-specific servers without facing
the ``client-level server'' problem.  For example, the Paradise
project&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node7.html#dlpy:par">DLPY93</A>] is already using the Shore
storage manager to build a geographic information system.

 }\end{figure}"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
Finally, Shore is intended to be much more of a
complete system than ESM.  In addition to a more flexible process structure
and support for typed objects, Shore provides other services
that end users should find attractive, including a
name space and access-control model similar to Unix, a Unix-compatible
interface for legacy
software tools, openness in the area of language bindings, and traditional
database services such as associative data access, indexing, and clustering.
<P>
The remainder of this document is organized as follows.
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#overview:basicconcepts">2</A>
provides an overview of the services
provided by Shore, including both its file system and database
features.  The Shore process architecture is described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#overview:architecture">3</A>.
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#overview:status">4</A>
describes the state of the system's various
features as of the time of this Shore release.
Finally, we conclude in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#overview:concl">5</A>.
The software described here is not simply
``paperware.''
