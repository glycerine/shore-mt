What to Include</A>
</H1>
<P>
The more information you can give us about the problem and the environment
in which it occurs, the faster we can resolve the problem.  Below is
a list of information that is helpful to us.
Not every item is appropriate for a particular report, but please include
whatever you can.
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Tell us what release of Shore you're using (the current release is
Version 1.1.1 ).
<DT>2.
<DD>Tell us what operating system and architecture you are using.
<P><DT>3.
<DD>Indicate whether you are using one of the binary releases
(and if so, whether it is the debugging or no-debugging version)
or you compiled Shore yourself.
If you compiled it yourself, what version of the
compiler did you use?
What configuration options did you use (IncludeDebugCode, Optimize, etc.)?
Include a copy of <TT>config/config.h</TT>.
<P><DT>4.
<DD>Is the problem reproducible or sporadic?
If it is reproducible, tell us exactly what sequence of events led up to the
problem.
Send us a typescript if possible.
<P><DT>5.
<DD>What compiler (including version) are you using to compile
your application (or value-added server, if that's what
you are building)?
Run <TT>gcc -v</TT> to get this version number.
If this is not a version supported by Shore
(see the <A HREF="../installation/node3.html#installation:requirements"><EM>Requirements</EM> </A> section
of the
<A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="../installation/installation.html">Installation Manual</A>),
don't send a problem report;
upgrade your compiler.
Similarly, check versions of other software mentioned in the
<A HREF="../installation/node3.html#installation:requirements"><EM>Requirements</EM> </A>.
<P><DT>6.
<DD>What error messages or warnings were produced by your
failed program?  Don't try to reproduce them from memory.
Yank the messages verbatim with your mouse, or better still capture the
output by rerunning your program with the Unix
<TT>script(1)</TT> utility and send the resulting <TT>typescript</TT>.
<P><DT>7.
<DD>If the program that failed is a client, what did the server
have to say about it?
Did the server produce any error messages?
If possible, run the server in the foreground with a Tcl shell
and type &quot;suppress off&quot; and &quot;log client info&quot; before
running your client.
Once again, capture the actual server output and include it with your bug
report.
<P><DT>8.
<DD>If your program aborted with a segmentation fault
or an assertion failure, try to get a stack trace with
<TT>gdb</TT>
and send us the result.
<P>
If your program does not get a segmentation fault,
but does get another error, run it with
<TT>gdb</TT> and get a stack trace at
<TT>perrstop</TT> (unless you are writing
your own value-added server and using the Storage
Manager directly).
<P>
Please do your best to track down the source of the
problem with <TT>gdb</TT>, debugging print statements,
and other debugging tools at hand (that is, to give us a reasonable
amount of detailed information).
Remember that Shore is freeware; the project runs on limited
resources, and every bit of help you can give us
allows us to do more work on Shore extensions.
<P><DT>9.
<DD>If you cannot compile your program because you get a compilation
error that you do not understand, and if the error appears to be in the
Shore sources, try using the <TT>-E -dD</TT> options on <TT>gcc</TT>.
Send the output to a file and look at the file.
Often these problems are due to the fact that a file (included before
<TT>config.h</TT> or before the C++ language binding)
defines a C-preprocessor-macro that
confuses matters.
<P>
If you cannot glean any useful information from this,
use the <TT>-E -dD -P</TT> options on <TT>gcc</TT>, and
pipe the results to a file <TT>junk.C</TT>. Compile
<TT>junk.C</TT> with gcc.  Often this will pinpoint the problem.
<P>
If you still cannot glean any useful information,
send us <TT>junk.C</TT> <EM>in a separate mail message</EM> , with
the subject &quot;junk.C&quot;.
