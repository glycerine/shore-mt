This directory contains an example program called "shls" (Shore ls),
which is a simple "ls" program for Shore directories.
To compile it, copy
Makefile.template to Makefile, edit the INSTALL_DIR variable in
Makefile to point to the top of your Shore installation directory, and
type "make".

The usage of shls is: shls [-i] [path...]

Shls run without any arguments is equivalent to "shls /".  Any number of
pathnames can be given.  If a path refers to a directory, then its
contents are listed.  Otherwise, the given pathname is listed if it is a
valid name.

Shls optionally accepts the "-i" flag, which, by analogy with the "-i"
flag of UNIX ls, prints the logical oid corresponding to each pathname
along with the pathname itself.

Shls always considers itself to be in the root directory ("/") of the
Shore filesystem.  Therefore, it make no difference whether the
pathname arguments are relative or absolute, although shls accepts
either form.
