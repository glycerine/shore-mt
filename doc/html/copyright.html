<h1><a class="anchor" name="COPYRIGHT">Copyrights and Licenses</a></h1>The main code base of the storage manager is subject to the SHORE/UW copyright (given below) and most of it is also subject to the SHORE-MT/DIAS copyright (also given below). Both copyrights are hereby extended to the date of this release, 2010.<p>
The atomic operations library is taken from the OPENSOLARIS release and is subject to Sun Microsystems copyright, and to the OPENSOLARIS license, found in src/atomic_ops/OPENSOLARIS.LICENSE. It is lengthy and so it is not included here.<p>
The strstream compatibility code found in <a class="el" href="d6/d38/w__compat__strstream_8h-source.html">src/fc/w_compat_strstream.h</a> and <a class="el" href="d4/d45/w__compat__strstream_8cpp-source.html">src/fc/w_compat_strstream.cpp</a> is subject to the Silicon Graphics copyright, below.<p>
The regex code found in the src/common/ library is subject to the Henry Spencer/ATT copyright and license, contained in <a class="el" href="d6/daf/regex2_8h-source.html">src/common/regex2.h</a>, and included below.<p>
What little remains of the old SHORE sthreads library is subject to copyright given in those source files (<a class="el" href="d3/de1/sthread_8h.html">src/sthread/sthread.h</a>) as well as to the SHORE/UW and SHORE-MT/DIAS copyrights.<p>
